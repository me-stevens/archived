<p>In my IPM, which lasted about two hours, I was given work for the next three weeks, since everybody will be out for holidays.</p>

<p>I also complaint that I feel like I am not learning enough, that I've been working with the same code for two months (almost three), and the only thing I seem to be doing is refactoring. Of course I learn some things here and there, but I'm sure this apprenticeship is not about learning some random thing, every blue moon, by accident.</p>

<p>I remember <a href="https://twitter.com/LeaVerou/status/667195839220092928">one tweet from Lea Verou</a>. She said, sarcastically, that if you spend one month refactoring, nobody will thank you. It was the typical Lea's exaggeration to prove a point, and I found the discussion in the tweets that followed interesting, so I shared it with everybody. I also remember the over-reaction of the craftspeople, they focused only on the "one month" part, and not in the conversation or the fact that it was an exaggeration on purpose.</p>

<p>Yet <strong>that's exactly what I've been doing. I've been refactoring for (more than) one month</strong>.</p>

<p>I also complaint that I get few or no feedback at all from my mentors. It suddenly has become a relationship in which I just arrive to the IPM to pour Life, the Universe and Everything else into a black box, and nothing comes out of it. It's like there is a wall or something. Am I getting better? Am I getter worse? Can we explore new horizons? Can we try new things? Where exactly am I failing the most? Is there anything we have to work harder on? Is there anything I could bring to the table? Am I too slow? I keep asking for good codebases to take a look at, I keep asking to do this and that, but I'm always told to go back to the comfort zone of my Tic Tac Toe with no other feedback. I would love to visit a client site, even if only to observe the dynamics, and learn. I never worked with clients (apart from when I worked as an illustrator, but that's very different). I would love to start a different project, learn a new language, maybe do something with Arduinos, I don't know.</p>

<p>Finally, I have noticed that more and more people are reading my blog, and they are starting to share it with their friends. That freaks the shit out of me. Nothing in this job has to do with me being a public figure or a rockstar. I'm happy to help with anything... in the background. Is like pictures, I don't like any pictures of me posted online without my permission. <strong>I always get asked why</strong>.</p>

<p>The question is quite offensive! It's like, when somebody says: "<em>Hey, I'm gay</em>". And people is like "<em>BUT WHY ARE YOU GAY</em>". Well... why are you heterosexual to begin with? What if I told you that you have been brainwashed into being heterosexual? Would your world fall apart? <strong>Those questions make no sense. Yet people seem to find them so appropriate</strong>.</p>

<p>Another thing people do is to confuse things. Like confusing honesty and transparency with privacy. Like saying that I would have to write posts for our site. Why would I have a problem doing that? What does that have to do with my PERSONAL blog? Maybe the problem is that people keep mixing personal and work stuff. There is a line. <strong>My twitter is MINE. My blog is MINE. My body is MINE</strong>. I will never approve any invasion of them.</p>

<p>Anyway, whatever I do, I'll always be honest. I'm honest in the stand-up, I'm honest in my IPMs, I'm honest in this blog, I'm honest with the people around me. If people choose to be fake is their problem. But I am honest, I value honesty, and I want people around me to be honest with me as well.</p>

<p>Maybe that's why I love Emily! SHE'S TRANSPARENT.</p>

<p><strong>END OF RANT</strong>.</p>




<h2>Nice things</h2>

<p>I'm not the cheating type, but, today I cheated the team: I went for a beer with someone else! OMG DOES IT MEAN THAT I FINALLY HAVE A LIFE.</p>

<p>But seems that my non-cheating type is too present, because Rabea was with me, and we were 50% of the group. </p>

<p>Anyway, we had a great time, a friend of Rabea was visiting, so we took him out for beers and Rabea's partner in crime, Matt, came too. Her friend was a super cool guy who kept us always talking about funny stuff and his life experiences (like when he spent the most expensive taxi ride of his life, for his forty's birthday, because they destroyed the taxi). And also, HE GOT ALL OF MY JOKES. I'm not crazy! (to be honest, Rabea also usually gets me when I joke).</p>

<p>I finally tried the typical British dish, fish and chips, in a bar suggested by a British (Matt). So I feel like I have ticked two boxes tonight. Well... one and half, he he.</p>
