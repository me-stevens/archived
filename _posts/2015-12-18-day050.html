<p>OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG</p>
<p>I HAVE AN ARDUINOOOOOOOOOOOO</p>

<p class="footnote">(You can jump to 0:24)</p>

<p>Today <strong>Micah brought a big box with ARDUINOS FOR ALL</strong>. OMG I can't even speak. We were doing that the whole day (at least me) and only stopped to hear his talk about why we need craftspeople, and to attend my IPM.</p>

<p>Even though I'm a very simple person, I would never imagine that such a small gesture could make me so happy. I opened the box, so shiny and new. I took everything out with the most delicate care. I read everything, even the small font. I almost didn't want to use it, because it was so new and so shiny and....</p>

<p>This model is an Arduino Uno, which is <a href="{% post_url 2015-11-27-day035 %}">a bit smaller than the Decimilia</a>. AND IT CAME WITH AN LCD SCREEN. AND SERVOS. OMG OMG OMG OMG</p>

<p><em>Takes some air</em>...</p>

<p><em>Tries to relax</em>...</p>

<p>Jarkyn and me were in the first row, and I think we made the whole universe run out of sparkles. They were all there with us.</p>

	<figcaption>IT'S SO SHINY.</figcaption>

<p>I took the book, which smelled like new books smell, and read each and every page. I went with Jarkyn through every exercise, in order. I didn't want to jump or be faster than the others. <strong>I WANTED TO BE ONE WITH THE UNO. lol.</strong></p>

<p class="center"><strong>...ME NEEDZ MOAR BOLD!!!<br>
	BOLD NOT ENOUGH TO EXPRESS!!!</strong></p>

<p>I went so slow that I only finished the first five exercises in the book. It was like when you are eating your favorite ice cream and you eat it so slowly because you want to enjoy it and you don't want to run out of it.</p>

<p>Then, it was time to go home for everybody who was leaving the country to spend the holidays at their home town. For example, Otto, who we are not going to see again, went back to mother Estonia (he said he would visit though). We went for some beer to the pub and Micah asked me to join him, his wife, Felipe, Christoph and Georgina for dinner at the Suchy's, where they are staying while they are here.</p>


<p>During the dinner, somebody asked <strong>why Uncle Bob is called like that</strong>, and Christoph said he read in one of his books that he appreciated family a lot. But Micah told us a different story!<p>

<blockquote>
	<p>Apparently, when he was young, one of his coworkers used to call him Uncle Bob. He hated that, because for him, an uncle is somebody old and fat.</p>
	<p>Many decades later, they found each other again in a conference, and the guy called him Uncle Bob again. But then he decided to stick with the name, because now he was old and fat.</p></blockquote>

<p><em>Don't miss the next story by Micah, TUNE IN NEXT WEEK. SAME BAT-TIME, SAME BAT-CHANNEL</em>!</p>





<h2>Nice things</h2>

<p>This is very stupid, but I loved CJ's Christmas sweater, and later he also gave a Christmas card to each of us. That was so cool!</p>
