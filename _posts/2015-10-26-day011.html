<h2>Today I learnt</h2>

<p>Mondays are IPM day for me. I'm so surprised that I managed to finish everything for this week, since I had a small crisis last week: <strong>I didn't ask for help because I was so ashamed of my code, and thought I could go on for a little bit more and make it better, but it only kept getting worse</strong>. I wasted my time (and probably Jim's time too, since he's paying me to learn), and didn't get things done. Then I had to rush to finish it all on Sunday and part of today's morning.</p>

<p>Since "exposing your ignorance" is one of the apprenticeship patterns, and I have minus infinite ego, I just told everybody in today's stand-up to not be like me and ask for help. Now I have to apply my own advice on myself.</p>

<p>Jim asked me what was my experience reading the book. I thought many times: "why is he doing this now? where does he want to go with this? even though at the beginning of every chapter, he explains what he is going to do. It's not straight forward for me why he makes the decisions he makes. <strong>Jim told me that's the way it is, that it's ok to let the tests rule and decide where you go next</strong>. I have to get used to that feeling!</p>

<p>Regarding the CodeWars katas, Christoph is not convinced that they are very useful to teach TDD, and Jim agrees, adding that they might be more useful for learning a new language, or working on a problem for the sake of the problem. So this week I got no katas. I may be doing some anyway, just 'cause I enjoy them.</p>

<p>My work for this week is <strong>to create an Echo Server</strong>. I'm going to work on a Java version of Tic Tac Toe but with a console UI, so Jim want's me to start by <strong>TDDing the IO, for which I just learnt that people create what's called "a mock"</strong>. There are other concepts too, like "stub" and a "fake", of which I had never heard before. Jim also mentioned "dependency injection", another concept that's probably coming from the Computer Science degree I lack. I have many new things to learn this week, but I'll handle!</p>












<h2>Challenges</h2>

<p><strong>My screencasts are still too slow</strong>, they keep getting 20 minutes long, and I see myself stopping sometimes and get angry at me. "What am I stopping there for?" Christoph told me it happens the same to him when he sees himself on a screencast. I wonder if I'll ever become a faster typer... is not that I don't type all day! That's for sure.</p>

<p> I'll have to screencast the roman numerals kata again this week. Jim told me <strong>to not think of the time, to not rush, just concentrate in the next smallest, tiny step</strong>.</p>

<p>Also, because the video I uploaded was the fourth in a row that I recorded, I didn't realize that I have some weird refactoring stage at some point, where it shows that I know what the solution is, and I am freaking out because I want to have it written down fast. It's a part of the code that I couldn't see how to break in little steps, although once Jim explained me how to do it, I remembered doing exactly that with Christoph.</p>

<p>Next week I'll probably have to read a book on refactoring.</p>











<h2>Nice things</h2>

<p><strong>This Saturday was Priya's talk in front of a bigger audience that she's used to, and she nailed it</strong>. Twitter exploded, which was funny because we where having the event inside Twitter's building. Jarkyn also said a few words about the company and what do we do. Emily, Amelia and me, just wandered around people telling them how OSOM we are, and giving them free stickers.</p>

<p>Also, there was a talk by comedian and public speaker DeborahFrances-White, about public speaking and how to be a lion on stage instead of a gazelle, which was very enlightening. It reminded me of Angela Gossow, and how she explains that, when she is on stage, she becomes a monster, a dragon. And everytime I see her performances, she makes me feel powerful as well. How can you not feel powerful after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHwhJLYoqbA">something like this</a>? Kind of makes me wanna watch it before going on stage, if I ever have to go on stage again (it's been a long time).</p>
