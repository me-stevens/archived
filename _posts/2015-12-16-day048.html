<h2>Today I learnt</h2>

<p>I keep having new ideas to improve the Tic Tac Toe, but they are so bad that it's getting very frustrating. So, today, I'm gonna jump to the nice things.</p>






<h2>Nice things</h2>

<p>Today I worked from home because somebody was coming to install internet. AND...</p>

<p class="center">I FINALLY HAVE INTERNET AT HOME!!</p>

<p>As the wise man said:</p>

<blockquote>Enlightening is,<br>
when you can sit in the bathroom with your laptop.
</blockquote>

<p>I feel like shaving my head and running naked down the street shouting: "<em>I HAVE INTERNEEEEEEEET</em>", and hugging people until they call the police.</p>

<p>But I'm not gonna do it.</p>
â€‹
<p>Because I'm enjoying sitting in the bathroom with my laptop.</p>

<p>Also, today was the last codebar session of the year (now for realz!) and...<br>
I found Abi again.</p>

<p>...Abi!</p>

<p><strong>My first codebar student in my first codebar session during my first day at London that was also my first day at the office!</strong></p>

<p>PHEW!</p>

<p>It has rained since that day<sup><a href="#meaning">[1]</a></sup>. I think I have this job thanks to her. To this time, I had a lot of students that were clearly enjoying our coaching session, but there has been no other student that was ever so excited at what we were doing in front of the screen. Now she is learning Python!</p>

<p>I also found amazing Kara, and we talked about everything from places to visit in the UK to the Nazca lines in Peru. It was cool to see her again!</p>

<p>Finally, the young lady who I told to come to codebar at the CodeFirst Girls conference came again to say hello. Today was a day of nice encounters!</p>

<p id="meaning" class="footnote"><sup>[1]</sup> It's a Spanish expression. I'm sure it doesn't translate correctly, mwehwehehehehehe!</p>
