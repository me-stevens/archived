<h2>Today I learnt</h2>

<p>40 days already! Also, 5 months since US's independence day. OR EVEN BETTER, SEVEN SINCE MAY THE FOURTH.</p>

<p>This Friday was private for 8LU, although we had Cedric visiting our headquarters, and Mollie was also coming, but at the end she had to cancel.</p>

<p>For the presentations, Priya was first. <strong>She demoed her AMAZING Mine Sweeper, which is the source of all our green envy</strong>. It's only in console version at the moment, but it has colors and everything [INSERT SPARKLES HERE]. She explained how she did the recursive search, which clears the board when the user clicks on an empty cell. We were presented with an animated graph that highlighted every node as it passed through them. She also showed us the UML diagram for her codebase, which in IntelliJ is only possible to see if you have the paid version, which she has in trial period. It was all so COOL.</p>

<p>Mateu gave another OSOM talk, this time about Arduinos and how to make the simplest examples work, which is <a href="{% post_url 2015-11-27-day035 %}">what we practiced last week</a>. He compared the boards of Arduinos, Raspberry Pis and desktop computers so that we had an idea of were each thing is in terms of processor speed and RAM memory. He ended up showing <strong>an electronics project he did for a friend, where he build a customized joystick to play Mortal Kombat, with customized attacks programmed also</strong>. Like, HOW COOL IS THAT. I hope he keeps on giving talks like this! Even better if we build something together... I'm thinking of a company T-Shirt with an animated display logo, or a flying drone or something. I'm sure the others would come up with much better ideas.</p>




<h2>Challenges</h2>

<p>THE TAAAAAAALLLLLLLLKKKKKKKK</p>

<p>How many talks have I given in my life? TOO MANY. THE ANSWER IS ALWAYS TOO MANY. I never liked public speaking, public exposure, public anything. And on top of that, I didn't like what I did for my presentation. AND, I was not an expert on the OCP, AND the example was not 100% correct, AND it was childish, AND it's been three years since the last time I had to give a talk, AND, AND, AND, &amp;&amp;, +, PLUS....</p>

<p>Also, the talk revived the negative talk memories I have from my "<em>previous life</em>". Maybe I just have to overwrite those bad memories with new, COOL ones. But the only thing I wanted at that moment was to RUN AWAY, FAR, FAR AWAY, TO A FAR AWAY GALAXY.</p>

<p>I could see all the things that were wrong with my talk. But I'm sure I was <strong>the only one who could see them</strong>. I'm pretty sure my audience loved the talk. It's like, when I did my illustrations in the past, and everybody was like "<em>Oh, it's so biutiful</em>", but I could see all the defects. I think <strong>my</strong> expectations for this talk were too high and I couldn't even meet my own quality standards. An invisible clone of myself was in the audience telling me "<em>You can do better than that! What? You were working the whole week on your presentation to present this? Come on!</em>".</p>

<p>The worse thing is that everybody started making a BIG deal about it. Christoph told me to <strong>stop freaking the hell out</strong>. Jim came to say he liked the talk, and told me about the time he had to speak in front of Uncle Bob. Makis also told me that he liked the talk. I know that <strong>I really need to learn to FUCKING RELAX</strong>, and that this unhealthy perfectionism is going to kill me one of this days. But I would have preferred for people to forget about me!</p>




<h2>Nice things</h2>

<p>The day started with drugs and ended with alcohol. I only missed the rock 'n roll part.</p>

<p>In the morning, Christoph volunteered as my drug dealer, providing me with magic pills for my elephantic headache. And after work, we went for beers with Priya and Georgina, and had a nice chat about life, the universe, and everything else. I drank two of my dear Guiness pints and everything looked psychedelicly better.</p>
