<h2>Today I learnt</h2>

<p>Christoph continued helping us organize our ideas and our code by showing us another type of diagram, the <strong>Sequence Diagram</strong>. It allows you to show what's happening between the classes, how do they communicate with each other, what do they pass as arguments, if they pass anything, etc. I think it can help you understand better the flow of the execution at run time. He said you could detect a smell if you had too many arrows going from one class to the other.</p>



<h2>Challenges</h2>

<p>I finally have the time to try out <a href="https://github.com/LeaVerou/csss">Lea Verou's CSSS tool</a>, which creates presentations using html, css and javascript, so that you can open them with your browser. Which is cool, because browsers are cross-platform. I've been trying to find the time to use it, since a long time ago, and now I have an excuse to play with it, although i'm not using many of the nice things you can do with it.</p>

<p>This week, I've been reading a lot about the Open-Closed Princpiple for tomorrow's presentation, and all the resources I've found say the same things. It's almost as if they copy-pasted each other. Not that there is much to say about it, but still. <strong>In particular, there is this "shapes" example that appears everywhere</strong>. I would like to do something different, and if possible, funny.</p>

<p>The good thing is that I found good information on the different aspects of the principle, so that the presentation is not 10 minutes of a simple dull "<em>don't modify your classes, just add new code</em>". You can't strech that idea enough to speak about it for 10 minutes! I have more or less the outline of the presentation in terms of <strong>things around the principle that are not the principle</strong>, but help to understand it. The only thing I needed was a good story for the code example, to join everything together.</p>

<p>I've been struggling with this because, as I said, I wanted to do something funny. <strong>What's the point of doing a presentation about something everybody knows about if you can't contribute at least something they haven't seen before</strong>. So I decided to tell a story about an octopus moving to its new fish bowl (ANY SIMILARITIES WITH REALITY ARE PURE COINCIDENCE). But I couldn't make it work.</p>

<p>My initial idea was to <strong>have the octopus have just a table</strong>, so that it had to eat, sleep and shower all in the table. Then, I would apply the OCP by creating an IKEA store as an abstract factory that produced the different furniture. It didn't work.</p>

<p>Then, <strong>I thought about money</strong>. The octopus had to pay the fishstar, the seahorse and other marine creatures with some sort of species, and later I could create a money interface to fix the problem. I couldn't make it work either, and I also wanted to make it work for the other slides that were about different things, yet all of them were story-inspiring ideas. BUT THE STORY WAS NOT WORKING. AGGGHHHH.</p>

<p>Desperated, <strong>I called Priya and Rabea, who helped me with ideas for the code example</strong>. Priya suggested I used the concept of a house and extending it by plugging-in rooms, and Rabea helped with finding things to do like "<em>if dirty, shower</em>".</p>

<p>Finally, I was able to come up with a decent code example, but it was not perfect, it even was a bit childish, and I couldn't use it to cover the other ideas in the rest of the slides. It was only useful for the OCP itself and nothing else. So the octopus appears only in the first slides, and the rest of the slides are just boring bullet points about things I don't really know about deeply enough, so I probably shouldn't even mention them. But if I don't mention them, the presentation will be even more dull than it is at the moment.</p>

<p>It's happening again! When I worked as an illustrator and comic artist, sometimes I had this AMAZING idea in my head that was OSOM, and I wasn't able to translate it to the paper. It is so frustrating when that happens. You have a Monalisa all perfectly defined in your brain, but when you finish your art and look at it, it looks like a school kid drawing with circles and sticks.</p>

<p>I had big plans for this presentation. But the end result is CHOF. CHOF as in the onomatopeia of jelly falling to the floor, splattered all over the place. Sorry OCP, I know you can be COOL, it's just that I am not smart enough to make you look interesting. </p>
