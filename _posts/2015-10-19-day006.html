<h2>Today I learnt</h2>

<p>This Monday's <em>Zagaku</em> talk was by Enrique, and he showed us a new method to design your app: <strong>the CRC cards</strong>. CRC stands for "<a href="http://agilemodeling.com/artifacts/crcModel.htm">Class Responsibility Collaborator</a>". The model is about using paper cards divided into three sections: name of the class at the top, responsabilities of the class at the left, and classes that interact with that class to the right. For me the most interesting thing about this technique is, that it allows you to detect class couplings (when you see the collaborator of one class also has the class as its collaborator), apart of helping you organize your code. Also, I'm the kind of person who writes things down, so anything that has to do with using a pen and a paper is cool with me.</p>

<p>After that, I paired with Daniel on the roman numerals kata, but it turned out to be a bit of a disaster. Daniel is so relaxed, so I just started letting myself be carried away by writing production code without testing properly. On top of that, it didn't help that I haven't interacted much with him yet, so my ears are not used to his pronunciation, and I was having a lot of trouble trying to just understand the English. I really have to kill the hamster in my head and buy a new one. Looks like I got mine in a cheap shop!</p>

<p><strong>Today was my IPM</strong>, and I was told by Jim that I had to show a demo of my week. I hadn't prepared one, so we went through each of my stories in the Artisan webapp.</p> 

<p>We went through my screencast of the bowling kata, and Jim told me all my mistakes, for example, getting carried away writing production code without checking that the tests still work. Christoph was so nice to say that it probably would have taken me 5 minutes had I known the Intellij shortcuts. But the reality is that I am very slow typing. I also had a bug in the strikes conditional in the production code, where I looped over the rolls instead of looping over the frames, so I had to decrement the loop variable. I also didn't understand what happens in the tenth frame if you have a strike, because in that case you add TWO and not one roll. This made the test fail when 12 rolls were played. I was testing for 11 rolls, but that was my missunderstanding. One of my duties for this week is to make it pass looping in the rolls.</p>

<p>Finally, I got my duties for the next week:</p>

<ul>
	<li>I have to finish the roman numerals kata, which I was so happy to delete in front of Jim and Christoph, and it felt so good. I'm gonna start it from zero again.</li>
	<li>I have to continue reading the next 12-13 chapters of TDD by Example.</li>
	<li>I have to do at least three katas in <a href="http://codebar.io">codewars</a>.</li>
	<li>But basically, the most important one is, to learn to think in small steps, and stop trying to write all the code at once.</li>
</ul>

<p>I wish I could go faster, I have a lot to learn and my brain is so slow. I wish I could just absorb all that knowledge in just seconds as they do in Matrix. I'm so excited and pumped up to start working on a real project with the security that I'm not going to screw it up. But I still have six long months to go! At least they're going to be filled with lots of coding fun.</p>

<p>That's all for today. See? I can writez shortz postz.</p>
