<p>The Big Bang sets the beginning of time, space, and the universe as we know it. According to current hypotheses, one possible destiny for our universe would be to collapse in the far future into a Big Crunch from where a new Big Bang will be produced. Some even argue that this process  has been going on forever (Big Bang followed by a Big Crunch followed by a Big Bang and so on). Other hypotheses have it expanding eternally to die in a cold and lonely way.</p>

<p>Today was officially my first day at the office. And it is, in a way, my own Big Bang. There have been previous Big Bangs in my life before, but this is the one that is giving me the best vibrations.</p>

<p>I come from a very different world. I feel like I would need a whole post to write about the huge differences between these two universes in more detail, so I'll leave that for another day. But there is one thing that the two have in common: in my life, I've been surrounded by the smartest people you can meet. And, I'm so happy to see that I continue to be surrounded by smart people in this new universe that I am starting to discover.</p>

<p>One of the first lessons I learnt since I've been visiting the office is, that even if I've been programming my whole life, I've been doing it the wrong way. I never was a computer scientist, I was a physicist (well, I used to be one, in the dark ages). So our motivation was for the code to work, and to work before the deadline. We never cared about test driven development, best practices or code smells.</p>

<p>There were two main codebases we worked with, <a href="https://geant4.web.cern.ch/geant4/">Geant4</a> and <a href="https://root.cern.ch/">ROOT</a>. As far as my understanding goes, they were written by physicists, at least at the beginning. I remember I once heard somebody complaining that the ROOT libraries looked like they were designed by computer scientists... on their first month of college. However, that's what thousands of experimental physicist have been using (and will be using) on a daily basis at work. That really makes me think about all the things that were going wrong when I worked in the field. Now it makes sense!</p>

<p>The other Saturday, on the amazing <a href="http://codebar.io/events/uncodebar">un-codebar</a> event organized by the even more amazing <a href="http://codebar.io/">codebar</a> peeps, I met Nicky, a physicist that used to work in plasma and solar physics. For a moment I felt so pumped up to meet another physicist and the innocent and candid me fled away a bit. Then I remembered that he had also left research to become a developer, and my feet went back to earth again.</p> 

<p>I wish I had been wiser, like Nicky and Rockbot (a developer I admire and possibly one of the smartest people in the tech community nowadays). I wish I had left that world much earlier than I did. It's true that, thanks to it, I was exposed to things that I would never be exposed to, hadn't I worked in that field. But I feel like I wasted those years. So maybe it's about time to delete that  part of my life for one and for once, and just stop talking about it from now on. That door is closed, I'm opening a new one and will never look back.</p>

<p>Anyway, life goes on. <strong>I am super thankful to Amelia</strong>, who helped me to have my new life settled up in record time. A woman everybody should admire. She defines herself as "Mum, wife, daughter, sister & Craftsman", but she is much more, she's the force that keeps this team moving smoothly towards a bright future.</p>

<p>And I am so thankful that my previous Big Bangs didn't trap me in to die in an eternal expansion, but that I was able to kill them and be born again. It may be painful to read yourself after some years, but I hope that, when I read this blog after six months, I'll be able to appreciate how much I've grown up, learnt and changed, from a tiny singularity to a universe full of wisdom.</p>
