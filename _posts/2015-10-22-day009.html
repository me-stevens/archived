<h2>Today I learnt</h2>


<p>I finally could <strong>sit with Jarkyn and work with her on her GUI</strong>. She is making it with JavaFX and now she wants to test that the elements in the GUI are returning the right thing, for example, if she clicks on a cell and it returns the position, she wants to check that the position is the right one.</p>

<p>We found that there were already some frameworks that are used to test JavaFX GUIs, but Jarkyn wanted to do it al with JUnit first, just to understand what was happening and to have control and a feeling of how it worked.</p>

<p>Since she was passing the canvas to her GUI from the Main class, in order to run tests on it, she had to create an instance of it in some way. The problem is that <strong>this canvas is generated by JavaFX and you don't have access to the code that creates it</strong> (at least according to our ignorance). We found several answers on the web, and what they all had in common was that they were creating a Thread in the test file to run the launch method, with a <code class="language-java">@BeforeClass</code> modifier, then a static <code class="language-java">start()</code> method, then the tests. We didn't manage to implement any of the solutions, so I'm curious to see what the solution for those tests will be.</p>

<p>I have used Swing in the past to make GUIs, in the old days, but now I think it's dead. <strong>I had never seen anything written with JavaFX, but I found it to be more similar to the way in which GUIs are created in C#</strong>. I miss GUI creation, I had a lot of fun when I did my TicTacToe with C# and WPF, and I also learnt a lot. Would be nice to work on a GUI soon! I guess the closest I'll be to working in any GUI soon are the ones in my own personal projects, at least for now.</p>







<h2>Challenges</h2>

<p>Time flies! No joke. Is it the 22 already? My morning was spent at the Jobcentre, and I just could do a bit of the TDD By example exercises and pair with Jarkyn. That's all.</p>

<p>Also, I came to the office and found out through Slack that I have to prepare a 5 minutes lightning talk for tomorrow... I don't know what to talk about, and have no idea what I'm gonna do. Anyway, I'll handle.</p>








<h2>Nice things</h2>

<p>Today I got my NIN number! I had an appointment at one of the many London Jobcentres, and after making me wait the whole morning, it is done and I'll receive it in two to four weeks.</p>

<p>Also, Amelia had a small talk with us the residents to inform us about internal company commitments that are expected from us, and how things are similar or different from the US offices. Also, we gave her suggestions about things to improve, for example, organization wise, what to do when a visitor comes, how to book a room for an event, stylesheets to fill in, and all that. The idea of making an application to take care of all that popped out. <strong>I think it would be super cool to build something with the other residents!</strong></p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Kyle, a team member from Chicago, is making some sort of newsletter with crazy information about the team members</strong>, and wanted us to send him "any hidden talents or chill hobbies/interests other than software that you all might have". I am really curious about what the rest of the team have sent him!</p>
