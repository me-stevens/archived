<h2>Today I learnt</h2>

<p>Since this was my first day, I spent it mainly having everything set-up to start working smoothly. This included:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Brand new company email</li>
	<li>Invitations to the so many slack channels</li>
	<li>Making a new Artisan account</li>
</ul>

<p>And <em>what is an Artisan account, you ask, as you fix your blue eyes on mine</em><sup><a href="#becquer">[1]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Artisan is an internal web application to track work in the form of "stories", that are given a series of points depending on the time it takes to finish them, where half a day is 1 point. Stories are added up to an amount of 9 to 10 points per week.</p>

<p>In what is called an <strong>IPM</strong>, or "Iteration Planning meeting", your duties for the week are decided between you and your mentor, and the next Monday your work is reviewed. Stories also have three sates: <strong>Ready</strong>, <strong>Working</strong> and <strong>Completed</strong>. As you work on your stories, you should update their states, so that your mentor has feedback on your current situation.</p>

<p>So far these are my duties for the week:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Write a short bio (0 points).</li>
	<li>Have a picture of me taken by Enrique (0 points).</li>
	<li>Set up a blog (1 point). Would it help me with my Spanglish?</li>
	<li>Reading TDD by example and doing the exercises (3 points).</li>
	<li>Screencast the Bowling kata I just finished this weekend, once I'm able to do it in 10 minutes (3.75 points)</li>
	<li>Do the Roman numerals kata (2 points)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Challenges</h2>

<p>I like to be challenged, but the challenges I faced today were of a different type: I had to write a short bio, which means speaking about myself, which for me is uncomfortable and weird and awkward. I prefer to listen about other people's journeys, or talking about code.</p>

<p>The second and most challenging thing I had to do today is to have a picture of me to be used on the company website. It makes me uncomfortable to have pictures of me available so openly and publicly on the internet. But, this is how much I love to be here, that I'll make an exception for this. I see it as something I sacrifice in exchange for all the support the team has given me so far, and how well they have treated me.</p>

<p>Another challenge that is not new to me is, talking to people after a talk or in a social event. Today we had an awesome talk by Adam Tornhill. After the talk, everybody went to speak with those they new, naturally. When this happens, in my experience, you have two options:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You just fly around, awkwardly listening to a group's conversation, waiting for the moment to make a contribution, or</li>
	<li>You just (rudely) cut the conversation they're having, and do an entrance with a lot of swag. Pre-condition: to have swag, to begin with.</li>
</ul>

<p>I was talking to Jarkyn about this and how after all these years I haven't find the right solution for this. And, as I expected, she made a smart observation: just search for somebody who is alone. I guess if I don't find anyone, then I'll just choose a corner and be the lonely wanderer waiting to be approached.</p>

<p>I still have a lot of people to meet. But <strong>I prefer to meet one at a time</strong>, spend time actually knowing the person. I just find there is a lot of information to handle coming from a big group of people, and the interaction seems more superficial. Might it be some autistic thing?</p>





<h2>Nice things</h2>

<p>My mentor will be Christoph (who makes a good charge-doublet with Felipe). He's very calm and relaxed, so that will help me keep my feet on the floor. Jim and Amelia will also act as mentors.</p>

<p>Since this was my first day, I got invited to lunch and coffee with Jim and Christoph. We went to a Vietnamese and had the most delicious noodles.</p>

<p>We had Adam Tornhill talk in the afternoon, which was a total success. <strong>I loved the graphs he made out of data coming from the codebases of the companies he analyses</strong>. Would like to know the process to make those plots.</p>

<p>Jarkyn suggested that we hugged instead of just shaking hands, which is <a href="https://blog.8thlight.com/doug-bradbury/2007/07/19/shake-things-up.html">a big thing in the company's culture</a>. And a thing that I like! But hugs feel better. The problem is that only the women are doing it, and I don't know if I like that difference. I feel we should either all hug or all handshake. I'm starting to get confused, handshaking the women and hugging the men. This is because I have to stop and think about the gender of the person I have in front of me, which is not something I do often or I don't have so present in my mind.</p>

<p>Finally, the company has a huge diversity in age, gender, race and nationalities, something I love. I'm on my element!</p>

<h2>Other</h2>

<p>Last week Makis suggested I could work on the logo for an internal project. I love doing that so I accepted. I've done some sketches over the weekend, but I'm not too convinced of my ideas. Will give it another iteration next weekend.</p>
