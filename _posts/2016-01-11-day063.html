<p>Three completed months since I started!</p>

<h2>Today I learnt</h2>

<p>Mateu advanced a bit more into the explanation of how to reach the algorithm for the coin changer kata. He took a very experimental approach where he wrote the tests to make the repetition obvious, and it was an interesting trip. He hadn't done it that way before, but he underlined that <strong>his objective was not to arrive to the answer that he and we already know</strong>, but to find the way to think about a problem when you don't know the answer, and how to study it.</p>

<p>After <em>Zagaku</em> I spiked the affiliations part of the payroll application, in order to be able to time-estimate how long it would take me. <strong>I don't like how they do it in the book, so I'm gonna do it my way</strong>. I managed to finish the commissioned employee part of it during the afternoon. There weren't many surprises, it was very similar to the hourly employee!</p>



<h2>Nice things</h2>

<p>Yesterday was a Sunday, and <strong>I went skating for the first time</strong>, with Priya, Georgina, Dani and Dani's friend, Rosie. I went roller-blading (for the first time too) when I was 14 years old, and I had a funny but traumatizing experience that I wanted to overwrite with new, shiny memories. And I did, it was cool, I fell several times, but I would do it again.</p>

<p>In other news, I was also thinking about, <strong>how would an alien society be if the aliens could read each other minds</strong>?</p>

<p>Probably there would be <strong>no concept of privacy</strong>, and I wonder if they would behave as a <strong>collective mind</strong>. Oh, and there would be no traffic jams, because everybody would know what everybody will do.</p>

<p>I also wondered how would that shape the way you think when you are growing up. I imagine something like, your community telling you:</p>

<blockquote>Maaaake your beeeeeed....</blockquote>

<p>And you would reply to all:</p>

<blockquote>Ooooookkk....</blockquote>

<p>And what about:</p>

<blockquote>- Eeeeaat your vegetaaaables...<br>
- I dooon't like theeeem...<br>
- ALERT! ALERT! ALERT IN SECTOR 9!</blockquote>

<p>So, everybody would know that you don't like them. And your friends would invite you home for dinner, and (telepathically) say: I didn't cook vegetables. And you would smile. And everything would be EASY. And there would be no communication workshops, or fake people.</p>

<p>Like, you could easily think, "<em>I HATE YOU</em>", and the person would be instantly informed and would leave you alone, and they wouldn't need to bother trying to impress you. There would be no discrimination, just asshole-instant-discard.</p>

<p>The other side of it is that, if people know what others really think, <strong>they have to be more tolerant of differences</strong>, everyone would have to be more tolerant in general. Your world would be much bigger. You would already know since childhood about all the different views there can be. Also, imagine feeling what is it to be discriminated because of your skin color or gender, in your own mind. Or feeling other people's anger or sadness.</p>

<p>I wonder if <strong>your brain would be mega-big in order to be able to process all that information</strong>, or you would just develop the ability to discriminate background noise? I'm thinking of autistic people, for example. They can't discriminate, so, they suffer a lot of stress from the so many inputs they receive from the outside.</p>

<p>I mentioned it to Jarkyn and she pointed out that they would be SO FREE, because everyone would know what you think anyway, so you wouldn't be concerned. She thinks it would be proper anarchy. I hadn't think of that possibility! 

<p>I like to think about how humanity would be today if things were different around us or in the past. For example, if we had no eyes, which would be amazing, because <strong>people would sense you for who you are</strong>. Or if we evolved in a different direction and ended up being floating creatures who lived in the sky and ate gases. Or if we had no language, and we couldn't fool people with words. Or if we didn't have any of the thousand expressions we use regarding the concept of time, because we couldn't feel time but more like past, present and future at once, just as we see height, width and depth as tridimensional space at once...</p>

<p>At the end, our culture and society is so entangled to our environment, physical limitations and body design.</p>
