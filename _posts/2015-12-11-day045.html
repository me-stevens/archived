<p>Today was Friday, so we had a lot of talks and activities. Christoph gave a talk about <code class="language-javascript">class</code> in JavaScript that was full of Arnie's video-references. Otto gave his talk about his studentship and showed us his to-do list app, and Emily did the roman numerals kata in front of an audience.</p>

<p>The rest of the afternoon I spent it working super focused again, and I even had the time to pair.</p>

<p>Also, I have to say, I'm so happy that this week <em>happened</em>.</p>
<h2>Nice things</h2>

<p>Jim Slacked us from the airplane. He really misses us!</p>

<p>Also, Jarkyn brought two boxes full of donuts of all kinds. She had separated some in a small box for Leon, but we couldn't help ourselves and we ate them all.</p>

<p>WAT.</p>

<p>THEY WERE DELICIOUS.</p>

<p>WE ARE HUMAN.</p>
