<p>Yesterday and today I saw Christoph really worried about our IPM. He had time-estimated with Skim the story we were working on, related with infinite scrolling. Skim worked in this codebase from scratch for about two years, so, given a story, he knows immediately which files to open and which lines to touch. But Christoph hasn't worked with the codebase as much. So the story was <strong>a bit under-estimated</strong>.</p>

<p>So, despite seeing him work his ass off on this story, we delivered something like less than two points. He didn't want to deliver something unfinished or of bad quality, and I totally agreed with that. I wish I could have been of more help, I feel like I slowed him down.</p>

<p>We were lucky that our client was very nice and was OK with it. I guess we are only human, and sometimes things like this will happen. But we were honest and transparent with the client. And whoever knows me well, knows that I am all about honesty and transparency!</p>

<p>I got a one point story for me to work on until next IPM. I'm a bit scared because the codebase is huge, but at least I have Skim and Christoph in the office to ask for help.</p>

<p>At the end of the IPM, we showed them what we managed to do with the scrolling. It's working, but it's not finished yet<sup><a href="#infinite">[1]</a></sup>.  So even when we aren't going to deliver these points, a lot of job is already finished and we only have to polish it, so these will be easy points for next week. But not for this one!</p>

<p>Life is not a Disney movie, and <strong>we as apprentices should be exposed to this situations to learn how to deal with them</strong>.</p>

<p id="infinite" class="footnote"><sup>[1]</sup> It is a REAL infinite scrolling, because when all the articles have been fetched, it starts showing them all again, lol.</p>
