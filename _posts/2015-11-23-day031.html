<h2>Today I learnt</h2>

<p><strong>I just moved in to my new flat this Saturday</strong> (yoohoo), and there was a lot of chaos to deal with. So today I arrived a bit late (fixing survival things), and I missed the stand-up, the <em>Zagaku</em>, and... MY IPM. I was so sure it was before lunchtime, but it comes right  after <em>Zagaku</em>.</p>

<p>We had it after lunch, and <strong>Jim told me that he was out as mentor because he is so busy</strong> (I always wondered how he managed with so many apprentices). So he brought Enrique in as my new mentor, together with Christoph. I also always thought that Christoph was assigned as my mentor because he is so strict and GERMAN an I am so laid-back and SPANISH, so I could be kept with my feet on the ground. But having Enrique as my other mentor breaks this suspicion. I guess it is because he is so extra-mega-too-much-positive, while I am super negative. I hope we don't kill each other, lol.</p>

<p>After that announcement, Jim left the sofa and I went through my Artisan stories with Enrique and Christoph. This week's stories were broken down into little pieces and they were very easy to deal with although there were lots of them. The only one I couldn't finish (it's the first time I can't finish a story!) was the refactorization of the menu, with which I've been struggling for so long without finding an answer.  We went through the pull-requests and my mentors gave me some small refactoring ideas to improve the code, and then gave me the stories for the next week.</p>

<h2>Nice things</h2>

<p>This is really stupid, but Rabea brought carrots and a delicious dip (DIP jokes were assured) and Jarkyn and me couldn't help ourselves EATING.</p>
