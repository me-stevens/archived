<h2>Today I learnt</h2>

<p>Today I had a different kind of IPM. Christoph had to impersonate Amelia and act as "the client". Jim had cards and a pen prepared for me to take notes while the client asked for features.</p>

<p>The client wanted a lot of features and she wanted them for YESTERDAY. Well, nothing new under the Sun, LOL.</p>

<p><strong>I was asked to build a webapp for the quarter event</strong>, where Amelia can enter the attendees, add friends, and the attendee can select a group to be in. The attendees will then be split into four teams. The details and constraints of the requirements kept changing as we were discussing the task at hand.</p>

<p>They didn't say anything about which technology to use, so I guess I can choose. Or maybe I should have asked? AAARRGHH... ("<em>questions career... questions life... Oh, it was a typo! Cool...</em>").</p>

<p><strong>I don't think this iteration was so much about the code as it was about dealing with clients</strong>. I think Jim wanted me to focus on some things:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Ask the right questions</strong>, which I have no idea what they are.</li>
	<li><strong>Pull the client back when they ask for too many things</strong>, which was difficult because I was with the client in this case, LOL.</li>
	<li><strong>Do the smallest thing that can possibly work</strong>. Hi, I'm Over-complicator McClure. You might remember me from events as "<em>solving all Priya's katas with HashMaps</em>" or "<em>adding Ids when there's no need for them</em>"</p>
	<li><strong>Split big stories into smaller ones</strong>, which I also found difficult until Jim gave me a hint.</li>
	<li><strong>Provide value for the client in each story</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Regarding the third point, Jim really took it to the extremes. I was already thinking in the screens and the inputs I would need, and everytime he will tell me "<em>can you simplify it more?</em>".</p>

<p>So at the end, the webapp will just have a textarea and a button. The attendees have to be entered each in a line and the features separated by commas. To add a friend, comma plus one. To select a group to be in, comma the group name...</p>

<p>YEAH, I KNOW.</p>

<p>This means that I have to tell the user how to use the app. This is one of the first things you learn, your apps have to be intuitive and the user doesn't have to think when using them. Having to provide an explanation of how to use it feels weird and I know my eyes will bleed.</p>

<p>But that's what I'll have to do, unlearn how to do it correctly and feel weird. I don't think I'll deliver something like this to a client, but Jim kept insisting that <strong>the client wants it for yesterday</strong> and that I have to think in the simplest thing to do. So there goes my honor and integrity as a developer! LOL.</p>

<p>Following the tradition, and since it's an app to sort people, I baptised it as SortMan&trade;.</p>




<h2>Nice things</h2>

<p>Today Jarkyn was back, and it was so cool to see her again. She is going to pair with Christoph in the same client project I was working on these last weeks. She is a craftswoman now and I hope she is embracing it, but I am also glad that apart from that nothing has changed.</p>
