<h2>Today I learnt</h2>

<p>We had an <strong>amazing talk by Paul Pagel</strong>, the CEO of the company. Jim told me he founded it when he was only 24, and that reminded me I haven't done anything with my life yet. So I have to change that soon.</p>

<p>The topic of his talk was, projection and future expectations, regarding growing, scaling, etc. of a project, brand or company. This is exactly the kind of universe that is orthogonal to mine, and from which I have to learn a lot.</p>

<p>He started in my favourite way: with an interactive activity, like Mateu did on the Friday I was visiting the office. He asked us to dream about where will us be in five years from now, for which we had to describe the contents of an article that would be written about us in some media, and we also had to mention who wrote it.</p>

<p>I wrote a super silly text (oh, what a surprise!), because <strong>I thought it was just an exercise for us as individuals</strong>. But it turned out that we had to... READ IT OUT LOUD TO THE REST. My knees started to shake, and my face turned hell red. Lucky me, I was one of the last ones to read mine, so most of the team had already said very smart and focused things. But anyway, I wished for the ground to open under my feet and swallow me in. In case you're curious, I just wrote something about the apprentices making an OS that beat Windows and Apple because it was written using the best practices we are learning as residents. The fact that Paul decided to keep our writings only made it more embarrassing. I hope mine is lost and ends up burnt by a beam of Sun light in revenge (pun intended).</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it was a nice exercise, and I enjoyed listening to all the perspectives and points from these very smart people I'm working with. Specially Jarkyn, who I admire for being so articulate (I could hear her speak for hours!). Paul drew a very useful plot of quality versus price, and placed several companies over it. Which for me was interesting, because <strong>it gave me a perspective of where those companies are, and more importantly, where <em>WE</em> are in that ecosystem</strong>. But the most relevant idea of the talk was, where are we going? where do we want to be in 2016?</p>

<p>In other topics, today I started reading "<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Driven-Development-Addison-Wesley-Signature-Series/dp/0321146530"><em>Test Driven Development by example</em></a>", by Kent Beck. It's one of the stories I have to finish, and Jim told me to <a href="https://github.com/me-stevens/tdd-by-example">create a repo</a> for that.</p>

<p><strong>Test Driven Development</strong>, or "TDD", is something new for me. I have tested my code in the past, but never in this way. The first time I made tests as grown up people do them, it was for my Tic Tac Toe. Now I have to learn to write the test first, and the code last. Also, I have to learn to stop thinking about the big picture, because when you write code the TDD way, you have to start with very simple things. For example, a function whose only purpose is to <code>return 5;</code> and that's all it does, because you wrote it to make a test pass, and this test checks that the result of your function is 5.</p>

<p>So this is what I refer to when I say that "I've been programming my whole life, but I've been doing it wrong". This way of working blew my mind. When I paired with Mateu for the FizzBuzz in ruby, he told me that you have to write your tests in a way that you trust that the code is working for every possible case, without feeling insecure about it. For example, I would read an <code>if-else</code> statement and go through it thinking what happens in every case. Now, with TDD, I have to learn to stop doing that, and just trust the test.</p>

<p>The first thing I learnt from the book is, <strong>the TDD mantra</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>RED - GREEN - REFACTOR</blockquote>

<p>In other words:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>RED:</strong> you first write a test that fails,</li>
	<li><strong>GREEN or, "make it work":</strong> then you make it pass by writing the code that works in the simplest and fastest way, even if it is in the most ugly way like, <code>return 5;</code> </li>
	<li><strong>REFACTOR or, "make it pretty":</strong> at this point is where you fix duplication, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is so similar to what I used to do in web development, which was where I first heard about the concepts of "best practices" and "testing" at all.</p>

<p>The objective you follow with this mantra is, to <strong><em>write clean code that works</em></strong>.

<p>To finish with the learning department, today I had a Skype call with Mike Jansen, a craftsperson from Chicago, who told me about his journey as a developer, and asked me about mine. Then he explained to me <strong>how important clients are to the company, and how they build a relationship of trust with them</strong>. As I said, this world is totally new to me,  because I have no experience in a business environment and never had to deal with clients (could the government be consider your client?). He pointed me to some good resources on GitHub. I have a lot to read!</p>

<h2>Challenges</h2>

<p>I think <strong>time management</strong>, specially in regard to finishing my stories, is going to be a thing at the office. There are always a lot of things going on, which I like, but you may feel a little interrupted when you try so sink into the "genius at work" state. Anyway, I'd prefer this a thousand times over the situation in which I worked in the past. Never seen so much good vibes between the members of the team. It almost makes me want to sit in the distance and just observe them interact while taking notes.</p>

<p>I also paired with Priya to finish a kata that we had started past Friday. I love pairing with her because she is very smart and a fast thinker, her brain goes at the speed of light. Which makes a huge contrast with me, because <strong>I tend to overcomplicate things</strong>. This is something I have to work on.</p>

<p>The kata was very simple: given an input sentence, return a histogram of the frequency of the words in it, ordered from most frequent to less frequent word. I suggested we could use a HashMap, to associate the word with its counter. But what looked convenient at first, turned out to be overcomplicated. That's my fingerprint, I guess. I have a lot to learn!</p>


<h2>Frustrations</h2>

<p>Today I realized I write too much, so maybe I should try to make this posts shorter? They are a bit like a catharsis and are becoming a way to cope with <strong>the frustration of not being able to communicate as well as I would like to in a face to face scenario</strong>. Here I have my spell checkers and can use a dictionary. But even so, I still make a lot of mistakes on grammar, etc. I don't know when I'm going to master this language, but I think it's about time! It frustrates me to be so bad at it after so many years being my main communication language. I'm afraid of me talking to clients with this limitation.</p>


<h2>Other</h2>

<p>I met a new member of the team, Daniel Irvine, who hadn't been around the week I visited the office.</p>

<p>I also helped Georgina and Priya with the delivery of some boxes charged with a good amount of the company's swag to the <a href="http://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/">Codefirst:Girls</a> headquarters. They are one of those groups who very generously are trying to make things easier for people who suffer from discrimination in the tech industry. In their particular case, they are focused on helping females who want to become developers, and they organize all types of courses, events and activities. Our delivery will be used in their next conference. Although I think some of these groups have the wrong approach, <a href="http://pensieve.verou.me/post/54853162595/on-women-in-tech">for reasons Lea Verou pointed out</a> in a much better way than I could possibly express, I'm still happy to see people willing to give back to the community and devote their free time to help others.</p>



<h2>Nice things</h2>

<p>One of the first things I wanted to do when arriving in here was to find a band to play with, in order to make new friends, etc. But not many bands would be looking for a keyboardist, I fear. Then I realized that Georgina plays the violin and Mateu plays the drums, so maybe we could organize some jamming session in the future. I would also like to find time to continue trying to learn to play the flute, djemb√© and drums. Will I manage?</p>

<p>Finally, this is the second day I surprised myself <strong>coming to work with a smile in my face</strong>. I think it's the first time it happens to me in many years. I hope it keeps that way for the long run.</p>
