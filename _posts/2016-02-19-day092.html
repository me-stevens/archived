<p>Today we had Sophie visiting. She came <strong>to pair with all the craftspeople in order to join the company</strong>, so we couldn't pair with her, although it's always a pleasure.</p>

<p>Also, today is the day when <strong>Jarkyn received her challenges to become a craftsperson</strong>. In two weeks, we will have a new addition to "<em>the other part of the wall</em>". It's an invisible wall, that exists for some reason that I can't explain. But anyway, I really want her to pass her challenges.</p>




<h2>Nice things</h2>

<p>Yesterday I went with Jarkyn to an exhibition at the Wellcome Collection near Euston. It was about <a href="http://wellcomecollection.org/secrettemple">the Tibetâ€™s Secret Temple</a> (the <strong>Lukhang Temple</strong>). We couldn't finish it although we spend two hours there, because there were so many interesting things to see: videos, reproductions, small statues and figures, pictures, masks, traditional clothes, and what-not.</p>

<p>But it was also about the conversations and the thinking it brought. The subtitle was "body, mind and meditation in Tantric Buddhism". <strong>I got really inspired by all the cultural differences and their richness</strong>. I probably can't understand the reasons that led them to believe in the things they believed, but I am always admired at the things that different human beings in different parts of the world can come up with, many times they come up with very similar things.</p>

<p>For example, I told Jarkyn <strong>how many ancient civilizations had a serpent or dragon representation</strong>, and it was usually associated with good, with wealth, with happiness, with some god, etc. There were the Nagas, for Buddhists and the Indian subcontinent, which are always represented surrounding emperors or gods in sign of protection. The more heads it had, the more powerful the Naga was (and the emperor it was protecting). There were also the good luck dragons in China, and in Japan as well, where they were known as "<em>ryu</em>". There is Quetzalcoatl in Mexico, and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8I-IqSb7sY">diablicos</a> in Panama.</p>

<p>Even in my region, <strong>there was an ancient cult to serpents, before and during the Celt occupation</strong>. When the Catholics made their cultural cleansing, they associated those serpents adored by "<em>pagans</em>" (how they called anything non-Christian) with the evil. Makes sense then, that the devil is often represented as a serpent in Christianity. The near-solstice date of 25 December for Christmas was apparently also selected because it was the date of the Roman festival of Dies Natalis Solis Invicti (Birthday of the Unconquered Sun), so that those pagans were easier to assimilate into Christianity without changing much of their rituals.</p>

<p>But in my region, both cults got mixed, to the point that, <strong>in the stories that tried to represent serpents as bad, part of the rituals of offering gifts to the serpent remained as part of the story</strong>. And so there are lots of stories about the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enchanted_Moura">mouras</a>, which are cursed maidens. Normally, they appear out of nowhere to random guys who happen to travel through the forest, and they have to break the curse, by coming back the next day and offering milk or cheese to a snake. The snake is horrible and is nothing but the cursed moura. In some stories the guy has to hurt the snake, in others it has to take something from its mouth, for example a rose, to break the curse.</p>

<p>This, for me, is OSOM. <strong>A much older ritual, probably from before the Iron age, survived up to our days because it got mixed in the oral tradition with the stories that tried to condemn it</strong>. The mouras are really coming from Celtic water deities (mouras always appear combing their hair near rivers, lakes or any other masses of water), but the snake cult is much older.</p>

<p>Apart from that, I always thought the representations from those ages were done with so much detail and care, and the bright colors really catch my attention. Some of them were even so metal. Like the one below. I'll probably make a couple of illustrations out of this. </p>

<p>Another thing that I always loved is how <strong>sex is represented in a natural way</strong>, with no taboos, and they even consider it as a way to reach enlightenment. Even in Buddhism, the physical practice of sexual yoga is necessary at the highest level for the attainment of Buddhahood (although its practice is rare, because Buddhism is about not surrendering to desires).</p>


<p>I love these cultural exchanges, mythologies, and everything, and I'm looking forward to more exhibitions like this in the future.</p>
