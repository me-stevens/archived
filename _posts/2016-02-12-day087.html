<p>Today I practised Vim a bit more (yesterday I couldn't put my mind on it). I <strong>spent most of the day repeating the coin changer kata</strong>, thinking that maybe Christoph would come and tell me to perform it anyway. But today the crafspeople had a workshop from 13:00 to 15:00, which is when talks and katas happen, usually. So the day finished without me having to do it.</p>

<p>Also, Skim gave me some more Vim tips. Honestly, he has a lot of patience with me, trying to teach me for my good, while I can't stop ranting in the background.</p>

<p>It doesn't mean that today my mind was not somewhere else though. It was in the exact same place than yesterday. However I felt a bit less lonely, because <strong>Priya showed me some videos on her phone, that she purchased some time ago</strong>, with documentaries by Stephen Hawking. She told me she hadn't watched them since uni.</p>

<p>Then, Jarkyn joined us and we connected her phone to one of the big screens <strong>to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKBkyN5os9s">another documentary about the creation of the universe</a> and its evolution</strong>. It was OSOM. The <a href="https://youtu.be/TKBkyN5os9s?t=46m3s">part where they talk about the infinite possibilities for new universes</a> was so DEEP.</p>

<p>When the documentary was over, I promised Jarkyn that I would bring my Cosmos videos (the original Cosmos, the ones with my idol Carl Fucking Sagan) to share.</p>

<p>When the day was over, we went for some pints to the pub, with those who won't make it for Christoph's birthday party tomorrow, and then had dinner together. It was cool!</p>
