<h2>Nice things</h2>

<p>Today <strong>Rabea was sent to a client's site</strong>! This and the fact that she is already working on her Java GUI makes me very proud of her. And also very envious! I think all the apprentices have already been in a client site: Rabea, Priya, Cedric (who is just starting!), Jarkyn and Georgina (also soon after she started). <strong>I've been asking to go to a client site since I have memory</strong>. I requested it several times during my IPMs, I told Christoph, I told Makis when he gathered the apprentices to ask us about our needs.</p>





<h2>Other things</h2>

<p>I slipped an innocent "maybe it's because <em>I'm stupid</em>" and Rabea <a href="{% post_url 2016-02-09-day084 %}">bitch-slapped me again</a>. I told her that I am honest, and that is honestly how I feel every day. I don't even think about it, I have it so assimilated that the sentence comes out of my lips without thinking.</p>

<p>Then Georgina also told me to stop saying that, because, <strong>if a beginner hears me say that, they will be like "<em>Oh, if the squid is stupid then, what am I?</em>"</strong>. Jarkyn said that <strong>I can't be stupid because I have a PhD and I am a Physicist</strong>, to which the others agreed.</p>

<p>I think they have a point, and I can see their point. But I never say that I have a PhD or that I am a Physicist, because then people suddenly think you are a genius or something, and that is not true. That's because <strong>people normally have no idea about what it is that researchers do</strong>, or think scientists are these mystic beings that have a huge brain. Nothing further away from reality!</p>

<p>I am not in the mood to write a rant about that topic now... maybe in some future post (that will never come). It brings bad memories. But what's a physicist even? If anything, <strong>studying Physics was A LOT OF WORK</strong>. Nothing else. No brains needed! And what's a researcher even? Again, <strong>you don't need brains to be a researcher</strong>. You just need to be a masochist. The most accurate description of a researchers's life is probably in the <a href="http://phdcomics.com/comics.php">PhD Comics</a> series. If you read them all, you will know.</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm going to listen to Rabea and try to stop saying bad things about myself.</p>
