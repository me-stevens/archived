<h2>Today I learnt</h2>

<p>Today Christoph gave a <em>Zagaku</em> about the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BeckDesignRules.html">Four elements of simple design</a>, which are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The code <strong>passes the tests:</strong> Never submit a pull request if all tests are not green.</li>
	<li>It <strong>reveals intention:</strong> has good names, uses consistent language, etc.</li>
	<li>There is <strong>no duplication:</strong> no structure duplication, no dudplication of knowledge, etc. In other words, how many parts of the code do I need to touch to change something.</li>
	<li>Use the <strong>fewest elements possible:</strong> once you can't remove anything else without removing functionality, you are good to go. Fewer variables, methods, classes, modules, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sandi Metz also has her <a href="https://robots.thoughtbot.com/sandi-metz-rules-for-developers">four rules for developers</a>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Classes can be no longer than one hundred lines of code.</li>
	<li>Methods can be no longer than five lines of code.</li>
	<li>Pass no more than four parameters into a method. Hash options are parameters.</li>
	<li>Controllers can instantiate only one object.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is even a <a href="https://github.com/makaroni4/sandi_meter">Sandi Meter</a> that you can run against your code and it will tell you about its quality.</p>

<p>We also mentioned a lot of <strong>acronyms</strong>, DRY ("<em>Don't repeat yourself</em>") is the most famous, but there is also KISS ("<em>Keep it simple</em>"), BDUF ("<em>Big Design Upfront</em>") and JEDI ("<em>Just Enough Design Initially</em>").</p>












<h3>IPM</h3>

<p>After that, I had my IPM. I'm going to leave ConMan&trade; and <strong>start the Tic Tac Toe in Ruby</strong>. I also have to read the book "<em>The four rules of simple design</em>", prepare a <em>Zagaku</em> (something I've been wanting to do since a long time ago) and rewrite my post about SRP with an example from my code, because the example I used was wrong.</p>

<p>I also had to <strong>rewrite my SQL statements</strong> since I was using helper methods to generate the column names. From this I learnt that my helper methods could be turned into one-liners with <code class="language-ruby">join</code>, so this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">cols = "("
columns.each { |column| cols &lt;&lt; "#{column}, " }
cols.chomp(", ") &lt;&lt; ")"
</code></pre>

<p>can be written like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">"( #{columns.join(',')} )"</code></pre>

<p>I had some struggle estimating how much time will it take me to do a fully functional application with a 3x3 board and human vs human, and I listed pairing among the things that will take time from my stories. Christoph told me to stop pairing if that took too much time from my stories, but I don't want to stop pairing. I feel that every week it is more difficult to estimate time, although it should be the other way around. I also feel more and more insecure about my code as I progress.</p>

<p>I'm tired, I can't concentrate, I'm always thinking about work, I've been super negative these days, I'm sleeping bad, I'm stressed, I feel overwhelmed, my back is in pain...</p>

<p><strong>I think I might need a VACATION</strong>.</p>






<h3>Ruby Matrix class</h3>

<p>Since the easier way to start TTT is with the board, I thought about the best structure for it, and I found about <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0.0/libdoc/matrix/rdoc/Matrix.html">the <code class="language-ruby">Matrix</code> class</a>. This class is immutable and has a lot of nice helper methods that I think will make my life easier.</p>

<p>So I went to pry to search for the things I need. This is one way of creating a matrix:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">pry(main)> require 'matrix'
=> true
pry(main)> m = Matrix[ [1, 2], [3, 4] ]
=> Matrix[[1, 2], [3, 4]]
</code></pre>

<p>You can put anything in a matrix:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">pry(main)> strings = Matrix[ ["hi", "hello"], ["bye", "see ya"] ]
=> Matrix[["hi", "hello"], ["bye", "see ya"]]
pry(main)> booleans = Matrix[ [false, true], [true, false] ]
=> Matrix[[false, true], [true, false]]
</code></pre>

<p>You can access a cell typing:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">pry(main)> m[1,1]
=> 4
pry(main)> row = 1
=> 1
pry(main)> col = 1
=> 1
pry(main)> m[row, col]
=> 4
</code></pre>

<p>But you can not change the value of a cell. It's immutable!</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">pry(main)> m[row, col] = 5
NoMethodError: private method `[]=' called for Matrix[[1, 2], [3, 4]]:Matrix
from (pry):7:in `__pry__'
</code></pre>

<p>You can clone a matrix, and the clone pointer will reference a different memory position:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">pry(main)> n = m.clone
=> Matrix[[1, 2], [3, 4]]
</code></pre>

<p>However, I don't think I'll clone it this way, I'll rather turn it into an array, place the mark, and then create a new board from that array, since matrices are immutable:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">pry(main)> o = n.to_a
=> [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
pry(main)> o[1][1] = 5
=> 5
pry(main)> s = Matrix.rows(o)
=> Matrix[[1, 2], [3, 5]]
</code></pre>

<p>I just have to be careful with the syntax when modifying the two-dimensional array, since:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">pry(main)> o[1][1]
=> 4
pry(main)> o[1][1] = 5
=> 5
pry(main)> o
=> [[1, 2], [3, 5]]
</code></pre>

<p>But:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">pry(main)> o[1,1]
=> [[3, 5]]
pry(main)> o[1,1] = 5
=> 5
pry(main)> o
=> [[1, 2], 5]
</code></pre>

<p>It's easy to get a whole row or a column:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">pry(main)> m.row(0)
=> Vector[1, 2]
pry(main)> m.column(0)
=> Vector[1, 3]
</code></pre>

<p>Or a diagonal:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">pry(main)> m.each(:diagonal).to_a
=> [1, 4]
</code></pre>

<p>The anti-diagonal is a bit trickier, but since arrays can be reversed like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">pry(main)> o
=> [[1, 2], [3, 5]]
pry(main)> o.map { |row| row.reverse }
=> [[2, 1], [5, 3]]
</code></pre>

<p>You could get the diagonal of the reversed matrix:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">pry(main)> m_reversed = Matrix.rows(m.to_a.map { |row| row.reverse })
=> [[2, 1], [4, 3]]
pry(main)> m_reversed.each(:diagonal).to_a
=> [2, 3]
</code></pre>

<p>And there is a method to check if it is an NxN matrix:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">pry(main)> m.square?
=> true
</code></pre>

<p>With this I think I can start to work on the board.</p>
