<h2>Today I learnt</h2>

<p>Uku gave a <em>Zagaku</em> about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine">finite-state machines</a> which is a model of computation. The best part of it was when he show us how to apply it to a real case of business software. According to him, all problems could possibly be formulated in terms of the FSM.</p>

<p>Basically <strong>you have two states and two transitions</strong>, blocked / unblocked, like when you tap your contact card at the underground and the doors open, but only if you have enough money loaded.</p>

<p>In real life, when you "tap" a bunch of things happen: writing stuff to a database, charging a user, etc. For example, for one of our client projects, the state machine goes like this (more or less):</p>

<pre><code class="language-">unbooked => (start boooking) -> Preauthorize payment

Preauthorize payment
 if failure
   preauth failed
 if success
   booking tickets

Booking tickets
  if failure
    ticket book failed
  if success
    should book hotel

Should book hotel
  if no
    charge
  if yes
    book hotel

Book hotel
  if fail
    hotel book fail
  if  pending
    ---
  if success
    charge
</code></pre>

<p>Imagine this with if-elses! it would get ugly and nested very quickly.</p>

<p>This is like a chain of locked / unlocked states, where the unlocked of one is the lock for the next one, and so on. The pseudo-code looks more or less like:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">state :deciding_to_book_hotel do
  on_entry :decide_to_book_hotel
  event :book_hotel :booking_hotel
  event :skip_hotel :recapturing_payment
end

state :booking_hotel do
  on_entry :book_hotel
  success # do something
  failure # do something else
end
</code></pre>

<p>And so on.</p>

<p>The authorizations are recorded in a database table so we have a nice log and we can decide to print error messages and all that.</p>

<pre><code class="language-">ID  FROM   TO
 1  unbook preauth
</code></pre>

<p>So you can look at this and see where the problem is.</p>

<p>Uku told us that, for the state machine, they are using <a href="https://github.com/slagyr/statemachine/">a gem developed by Micah</a>! The gem uses probably a switch internally, but this is more explicit. You can look at the code and see what is going on. He has some <a href="http://micahmartin.com/statemachine/example.html">documentation pages</a> available. I will probably take a look when the apprenticeship is over.</p>

<p>Another example of problem where a state machine can be applied are TCP connections:</p>

  <figcaption>TCP connections can be modeled with state machines.</figcaption>

<p>However, this is a very complex problem, so maybe we wil have to wait until the end of the apprenticeship.</p>







<h3>Interactive Ruby Shell</h3>

<p>The interactive Ruby shell is "<em>a tool to interactively execute Ruby expressions read from the standard input</em>". I imagine it's very similar to typing C++ commands in <a href="https://root.cern.ch/cint-prompt">the ROOT prompt</a>, which has a command interpreter.</p>

<p>To start a session you type <code class="language-bash">irb</code> and the prompt appears. Then you type <code class="language-bash">exit</code> to quit.</p>

<p>I also just happen to discover the class <code class="language-ruby">Enumerable</code> in Ruby, and <strong>it blew my mind</strong>. I first tried to read through the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0/Enumerable.html#M003125">documentation</a>, but I couldn't figure out all the details. However, I found <a href="http://www.eriktrautman.com/posts/ruby-explained-map-select-and-other-enumerable-methods">this blog entry</a>, which comes with nice examples. It basically allows you to do a lot in terms of looping anything that can be enumerable (like ranges, arrays or hashes), <strong>in just one line</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>I have to implement a search in all my contact fields</strong>. At the moment they are defined as hashes and saved into an array. To make such a search, I would have to nest several <code class="language-ruby">for</code> loops and <code class="language-ruby">if</code> / <code class="language-ruby">else</code> conditions. I was pretty sure there was "<em>a Ruby way</em>" to prettify this, and that's how I discovered <code class="language-ruby">Enumerable</code>.</p>

<p>The class provides you with several methods, but I had to find the most convenient for this task that allowed me to type something readable at the same time. So I used the Interactive Ruby Shell to help me find out. First, I created an array of dummy contacts:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">contact1 = {name: "name1", address: "address1"}
contact2 = {name: "name2", address: "address2"}
contact3 = {name: "name3", address: "address3"}
contacts = [contact1, contact2, contact3]
</code></pre>

<p>And then I started a hunting adventure. First I tried <code class="language-ruby">has_value?</code> using the <code class="language-ruby">select</code> method:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">irb(main):005:0> contacts.select{ |contact| contact.has_value?("address2") }
=> [{:name=>"name2", :address=>"address2"}]
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that this method makes exact comparisons only:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">irb(main):006:0> contacts.select{ |contact| contact.has_value?("add") }
=> []
</code></pre>

<p>What about <code class="language-ruby">grep</code>? Does it work as in the terminal? Turns out it doesn't:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">irb(main):009:0> contacts.select{ |contact| contact.grep("add") }
=> [{:name=>"name1", :address=>"address1"}, {:name=>"name2", :address=>"address2"}, {:name=>"name3", :address=>"address3"}]

irb(main):009:0> contacts.select{ |contact| contact.grep("address2") }
=> [{:name=>"name1", :address=>"address1"}, {:name=>"name2", :address=>"address2"}, {:name=>"name3", :address=>"address3"}]
</code></pre>

<p>This was a desperate try with <code class="language-ruby">find</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">irb(main):008:0> contacts.select{ |contact| contact.find{|key,value| value == "address2"} }
=> [{:name=>"name2", :address=>"address2"}]

irb(main):010:0> contacts.select{ |contact| contact.find{|key,value| value == "add"} }
=> []
</code></pre>

<p>What about <code class="language-ruby">include</code>?</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">irb(main):005:0> contacts.select{ |contact| contact.select{ |key, val| val.include?("address2") } }
=> [{:name=>"name1", :address=>"address1"}, {:name=>"name2", :address=>"address2"}, {:name=>"name3", :address=>"address3"}]
</code></pre>

<p>Ok, let's swap that <code class="language-ruby">select</code> for an <code class="language-ruby">any?</code></p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">irb(main):024:0> contacts.select{ |contact| contact.any? {|key, val| val.include?("address2")} }
=> [{:name=>"name2", :address=>"address2"}]

irb(main):026:0> contacts.select{ |contact| contact.any? {|key, val| val.include?("add")} }
=> [{:name=>"name1", :address=>"address1"}, {:name=>"name2", :address=>"address2"}, {:name=>"name3", :address=>"address3"}]
</code></pre>

<p>BINGO</p>

<p>When I have more time I will also take a look at <code class="language-ruby">chunk</code>. Looks like <a href="http://davidlesches.com/blog/meet-chunk-and-partition-the-enumerators-you-re-not-using-enough-of">some kind of Swiss knife</a>.</p>

<p>And this is how cool irb is!</p>

<p>Apart from all this learning, Christoph reminded me that helper files like my <a href="{% post_url 2016-01-27-day075 %}">runtests file</a> should not be included in the repo. Ooops!</p>










<h2>Nice things</h2>

<p>Two very silly things happened regarding today's <em>Zagaku</em>. Georgina mistyped <em>Zagaku</em> for "<strong>ZagaUKU</strong>" in her blog and didn't realize it until I told her, but it was SO FUNNY. Also, Uku kept mentioning the pre-authorising, which totally sounds like "<em>Priyauthorising</em>", although I think we have enough with the <em>Priya pressure</em> already. Anyway, I was ROTFL.</p>

<p>Also, yesterday at Codebar <strong>I got a FREE book of Erlang</strong>, and guess what...</p>

  <figcaption>Learn you some Erlang for great good, by Fred H&eacute;bert.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="center">IT HAS AN OCTOPUS IN THE COVER</p>

<p class="center">IS THIS A SIGN</p>

<p>The book <a href="http://learnyousomeerlang.com/">can also be read online</a> for FREE. This is a language that caught my eye long ago when I visited he office for the first time.</p>

<p>DID I JUST SAY LONG AGO</p>

<p>OMG time flies.</p>

<p>Then, some months ago, we had a talk by Robert Virding about how it handles failures and it helps build robust systems and all that. <strong>It's kind of a VIKING language</strong>. Perfect for me!</p>

<p>Finally, and kind of a sad thing, Christoph changed his GitHub avatar. Why is this so dramatic that I have to mention it here? Because it had DA COOLEST HAT EVAH, so I'm gonna share it here (with permission) <strong>to keep its memory</strong>. He changed it to give a good impression to clients, although I'm pretty sure the impression would be +1000 times better with that hat. People would be like, "<em>WHO's THIS GUY. LOOKS LIKE THE COOLEST GUY IN THE UNIVERSE</em>.</p>

<p>Anyway, R.I.P. avatar :-(</p>
