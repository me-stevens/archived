<h2>Today I learnt</h2>

<p>Today I made <a href="https://github.com/me-stevens/payroll/pull/11">the longest pull request comment</a> in the history of pull request comments. Apart from that and helping Priya with her Tic Tac Toe minimax, there weren't any more highlights.</p>




<h2>Nice things</h2>

<p>I was a bit sad that <strong>my codebar student didn't come today</strong>. I had all sorts of things prepared for the site I wanted to build for her. But I think the location was not good for her to reach it on time after work. I hope she can come next Wednesday.</p>

<p>Anyway, <strong>Sophie came to codebar and I could finally pair with her doing <a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata">the bowling kata</a>.</strong> Long ago, when I met her at the <a href="http://codebar.io/events/uncodebar">uncodebar conference</a>, she told me she wanted to learnt some TDD and I suggested she could do that kata. Not because there was anything special with it, but because it came with a <a href="http://butunclebob.com/files/downloads/Bowling%20Game%20Kata.ppt">Power Point presentation</a> that explained step by step how to go through the process. I found it very handy when you are starting to figure out how to TDD. And... she followed my advice! She came to codebar to do that kata.</p>

<p>She doesn't know Java though, so we did it in Ruby. I think <strong>the steps are the same no matter the language, and the learnings too</strong>. So we went through it and, even though I have looked at the syntax of Ruby at some point, and tried to sit through tutorials to learn the language, my brain is a bit fucked up by C-like languages, which is what I 've used my whole life, so I'm not very good at Ruby. We had some compiler problems, and I learnt that the <strong>Ruby compiler error messages don't help you much</strong>. Hopefully, Rabea and Felipe were near and they helped us fix the problem.</p>

<p>I also had some variable initialized at the beginning of a class, and Felipe told me "<em>That's so Java</em>", lol. Then he told me that once I learn functional languages, I won't even have to declare any variables. I hope I can reach that stage soon!</p>

<p>After that, we went to the pub and even Denise joined us for a while to share some funny language swear words. With Germany, Uruguay, France, Spain and China represented in our tiny group, laughs were assured.</p>
