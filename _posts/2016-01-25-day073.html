<h2>Today I learnt</h2>

<p>Christoph was in charge of today's <em>Zagaku</em>, but he hadn't prepared anything because the issues we had in the corresponding repo were "<em>either too extense or too boring</em>", lol. So he asked us what we wanted to know about and we filled the whiteboard with a bunch of cool and interesting things.</p>

<p>I continued doing the almost 300 Ruby koans, but I couldn't finish them, so I showed Christoph were I got, and he pointed to the three I should at least do and then let the others for my free time.</p>

<p>Because I am adding stuff to the tests and changing things here and there to experiment with the language, I broke the thing several times. At some point I was almost wanting it to broke, because, when that happened, this BIUTIFUL ASCII ART WAS PRINTED</p>

<p>WAT</p>

<p>I LOVE ASCII ART OK</p>





<h3>Ruby Resources</h3>

<p>I also used this amazing resources for Ruby:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide">Ruby style guide</a> that I tried to follow today when I started the conman app.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/ruby-from-other-languages/">Ruby from other languages</a>, which is similar to what I started doing in <a href="{% post_url 2016-01-22-day072 %}">my last post</a>.</li>
    <li>This is not really new to me, but I find "<a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/ruby/">Learn X in Y minutes</a>" to be a nice cheat-sheet to have at hand.</li>
    <li>Random Ruby repos of our company's team.</li>
</ul>




<h3>POODR</h3>

<p>I also started reading Sandy Metz's <a href="http://www.poodr.com/">POODR</a> book, and I am enjoying it so far. These are some things I learnt today:</p>

<blockquote>Because there is no final authority on OOD, challenges to the principles (and to this author) will improve the understanding of all. In the end you must be the arbiter of your own designs; it is up to you to question, to experiment, and to choose.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>Getting the right message to the correct target object requires that the sender of the message know things about the receiver. This knowledge creates dependencies between the two and these dependencies stand in the way of change.</blockquote>

<blockquote>You must not only write code for the feature you plan to deliver today, you must also create code that is amenable to being changed later. 
</blockquote>

<blockquote>You should build software in tiny increments, going through short feedback loops.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Thereâ€™s a pre-existing class for every data type that you would expect a programming language to supply. However, object-oriented languages are themselves built using objects.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>The trick to getting the most bang for your design buck is to acquire an understanding of the theories of design and to apply these theories appropriately, at the right time, and in the right amounts. Design relies on your ability to translate theory into practice.
</blockquote>








<h2>Nice things</h2>

<p>This Saturday we had the company's Christmas party, and WE GOT SHINY GIFTS! There was a Raspberry Pi for each of the apprentices, because, <strong>what is better than having an Arduino? Having an Arduino AND a Raspberry Pi</strong>! INSERT SPARKLES HERE.</p>

<p>Then we had a bingo of weird team-member facts, and those of us who made a row could claim another present. So now I have a new shiny <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Arduino-Cookbook-Michael-Margolis/dp/0596802471">Arduino Cookbook</a> and an analogic camera.</p>

<p>Another fun fact of the party was <strong>Priya getting tipsy and talking about her minimax</strong>. Normally you would send embarrasing messages to your ex saying "<em>I miss you</em>" or "<em>I still love you</em>" and regret it the next day. It is definitely much better to talk about your code!</p>

<p>After the party, Felipe, Rabea, Christoph, Priya and me went to a super nice pub in Shoreditch to have the last beer, with our gifts and everything. I was also taking the Risk game with me to bring it to the office. I wanted to do the same with an unclaimed mini-arcade machine that had all these OSOM pixelated classic games from the 80's - 90's, but Nathan was faster than me and claimed it first!.</p>




<h2>Other</h2>

<p>Today we went to <a href="http://www.foundersandcoders.com/">Founders and coders</a> because Priya, Rabea and Georgina were giving a nice and fun talk about pairing. Sara filmed it on video and I took pictures. The students loved the talk but didn't have any code to review, so we went for a well deserved beer.</p>
