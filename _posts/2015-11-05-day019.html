<h2>Today I learnt</h2>

<p>I think I finally get spies. They are just a fabrication, a construction. They are not like the real thing. Their only purpose is to give you control over a class so you can pass it the values you need to test your things. Like, if you were testing what happens when your database or your mail server are full, you won't send emails like crazy in order to explode it and see what happens.</p>

<p>It's tricky because you are testing the real thing with something that is not the real thing, and some things you can do, but some other things you can not. So you really have to think about the consequences of what you are doing.</p>

<p>In Physics, sometimes you do something very similar in an experimental setting. And it would generate "phenomenons" that are very difficult to track, and if you were not lucky to realize that something was wrong before you go home, you would have a bunch of data sets that are nonsense, and would have wasted the very luxurious opportunity of having got measurement time in an accelerator facility. This is totally random and I don't know why I made such a connection here and now.</p>





<h2>Other</h2>

<p>I just realized that, for every apprentice, there is a blog, and for every blog, there is a daily post for around 6 months. Those are a good bunch of posts. And that's for EVERY apprentice. Millions of posts that are sent to the Internet to add up to the amount of noise and emptiness of the net. Does anybody really read all those posts? Does it matter?</p>

<p>My posts are not really good. I don't really say anything interesting, they are only used to record what I learn. They are probably only useful to me. And when this apprenticeship is finished, they will probably not be useful any more. It's very difficult for me to have something interesting to say every day. I try, but my life is just not that interesting.</p>

<p>In the old days, people used to write their stuff down in diaries. And diaries came with a key, because, they were "secret". They stored the most precious feelings and ideas that you wouldn't share with anyone, sometimes not even your best friends. But you needed to write them down anyway, because sometimes that's the only way you can deal with certain things floating in the back of your head. Those things that call your attention constantly until you deal with them, for example, writing them on a diary.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, diaries became blog posts, and blog posts where published on the internet, for everybody to read your opinions and whatever you wanted to share. And seems like everybody liked that attention, because the web got filled pretty fast with everybody's diaries. The term "attention whore" appeared. I wonder if anybody still keeps a secret diary, written with paper and pen.</p>

<p>The same happened with pictures. You used to have 20 or 30 per trip at most, and you placed them in photoalbums, that were saved in some cabinet at your home, and when your friends came over, you would sit together in the sofa and laugh together at the pictures, and share some nice moments. And they where the only ones who would see them.</p>

<p>Then pictures also became public (thanks Facebook!), to the point that nowadays, people feel weird if they take pictures and don't upload them immediately to some Internet image sharing service, for the whole world to see. Which is something I can't understand. Again, the term "attention whore" comes to mind.</p>

<p>People in twitter, in instagram, and everywhere, are trying so hard to publish the next viral thing, they try to be provocative, they try to shout out "hey, look at me! here I am! I need your aproval!".</p>

<p>I was never good at writing posts, and that's why I never had a good publishing frequency. The times I posted in my blog where, like now, because I learnt something new, or wanted to share some experience. So I'm feeling a bit guilty for contributing with so many people writing garbage and filling the Internet with nothing.</p>

<p>For example, this blog post today, it's coming out so negative. But I don't want to change it, to make-up it. I want my posts to be honest. I want me to be honest, and the people around me to be honest with me too. Why are humans so afraid of honesty? There are enough things not honest in this world to deal with.</p>

<p>I'll better switch to the "nice things" section now.</p>







<h2>Nice things</h2>

<p>I like to see that, because every day more and more people leave their previous jobs to become developers, the field is becoming so diverse and getting so much nice inputs from all kinds of backgrounds.</p>

<p>For example, <a href="https://twitter.com/kahliltweets">Kahlil</a>, from the <a href="http://reactive.audio/">reactive podcast</a>, used to be a hip hop artist. He is now a front-end JavaScript developer, and did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ1kY-CSpBk">this out-of-this-word-amazing-wise-thing</a> recently at JS conf. EU, mixing his two passions.</p>

<p>Or <a href="https://twitter.com/rockbot">Raquel VÃ©lez</a>, a mechanical engineer specialized in robotics, who joined robots and JavaScript so that we could have things like flying drones, nodebots, and what not, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v75aX5-gSA">all powered by JavaScript</a> too.</p>

<p>And Mariko Kosaka, who just wanted to knit in peace, and ended up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Cc1vrvjdY&feature=youtu.be">combining more engineering, history, creating her own programming language</a>, etc. etc.</p>

<p>These people really motivate me to continue and work on my own projects, and try to contribute something useful. I don't know what would it be, but I'll do it.</p>
