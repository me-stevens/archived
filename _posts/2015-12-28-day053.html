<h2>Today I learnt</h2>

<p>That there is something in the British culture called "<strong><em>Boxing day</em></strong>", which happens the day after Christmas, and as the name DOESN'T suggest, is about employers making gifts to employees:</p>

<blockquote>Boxing Day in the United Kingdom is the day after Christmas Day and falls on December 26. Traditionally, it was a day when employers distributed money, food, cloth (material) or other valuable goods to their employees. In modern times, it is an important day for sporting events and the start of the post-Christmas sales.</br>

</blockquote>

<p>So, guess what, "<em>boxing</em>" day is really about "<em>boxes</em>".<br>
He he.<br>
HEHEHEHE.</p>

<p>BUT, the summary here is that, today, EVERYTHING (including the office) was closed, because the boxing day fell on a Saturday. So, today, I worked from home.</p>

<p>I started reading Uncle Bob's book "<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Software-Development-Principles-Patterns-Practices/dp/0132760584"><em>Principles, patterns and practices</em></a>", since one of my stories is to read the first three sections and do the payroll example. This is what I learnt from the first section, <em>Agile development</em>:</p>




<h3>Agile programming</h3>
<ul>
	<li>There is a small introduction to the Agile manifesto, signed by a group of white-male computer scientists from the US. The four values of Agile Software Development are:<p></p>
		<dl>
			<dt>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools:<dt>
			<dd>Working well with others is more important than raw programming talent. Building the team is more important than building the environment. Don't assume than bigger and better tools will automatically help you do better, start small (for example, try files first instead of databases).</dd>

			<dt>Working software over comprehensive documentation:</dt>
			<dd>The team needs to produce human-readable documents that explain the system, but short and salient, so that they can be kept in sync with the code.
			</dd>

			<dt>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation:</dt>
			<dd>Work in short iterations directed by continuous feedback. The more frequent the deliveries, the higher the final quality. The contract should say how the team is going to work, but not the details of how things are going to be done.</dd>

			<dt>Responding to change over following a plan:</dt>
			<dd>As the team gains knowledge about the system and the customer about their needs, some tasks become unnecessary. Don't make any detailed plans for more than two weeks in advance.</dd>
		</dl>
	</li>
	
	<li>People always comes first. If the office environment is an obstacle to the team, the office environment must be changed. And: Don't be afraid of change. </li>
</ul>

<p>The last point resonates so much with me, he he. I wish we applied it in the office.</p>


<h3>Extreme programming</h3>

<p>Some practices of extreme programming or XP are:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Customer Team member:</dt>
	<dd>The best scenario is when the customer works in the same room as the team.</dd>

	<dt>User stories</dt>
	<dd>The conversation with the customer allows to get a sense of the details that need to be implemented. That allows a rough estimation. Stories are a short-term planning tool.</dd>

	<dt>Short cycles</dt>
	<dd>Iterations are two weeks long. Releases are done every three months.</dd>

	<dt>Acceptance tests</dt>
	<dd>Verify that the system behaves as the customer has specified. They are written by the customer.</dd>

	<dt>Pair programming</dt>
	<dd>There is a driver and a checker, and they change roles. Each programmer pairs with all the team, to spread the knowledge of the codebase. Less defects in the code.</dd>

	<dt>TDD</dt>
	<dd>Write a test that fails. Make it pass. Refactor.</dd>

	<dt>Collective ownership</dt>
	<dd>You are not confined to your specialty. All the team owns all the code.</dd>

	<dt>Continuous integration</dt>
	<dd>Any member can check any part of the codebase at any time. Updates are merged and integrated frequently (several times a day) to avoid problems.</dd>

	<dt>Sustainable pace</dt>
	<dd>Conserve energy and alertness.</dd>

	<dt>Open workspace</dt>
	<dd>"<em>The sound in this room is a low buzz of conversation</em>". I don't like the war reference at the end of the paragraph, it's VERY dodgy. On the other hand, I have strong opinions against open workspaces, but I'll need a whole post for that. Other people has already written about <a href="http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20140911-open-office-victims-push-back">how noise degrades health</a>, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-open-office-trap">increases sick leaves</a>, and <a href="http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20130801-the-great-workspace-debate">stress levels</a>.</dd>

	<dt>Simple design</dt>
	<dd>Get the first batch of stories working in the simplest possible way and delay design for the last part.</dd>

	<dt>Refactoring</dt>
	<dd>Do it every now and then, every hour or half an hour.</dd>
</dl>

<p>And that's enough reading for today, time to work on other items of my to-do list!</p>











<h2>Challenges</h2>

<p>Sometimes these books really fail at reaching me, because I find <strong>they are written in a way that resembles the bible of a sect that we must all follow</strong>, and there is a lot of preaching. Things <em>should be done like this, and like that, and this is the only way, because I say it so, and I am a rockstar in the industry</em> (although some books are worse than others).</p>

<p>Is not that there are not examples or that the concepts are not good or don't make any sense, nah. Some of them are actually interesting, practical or useful, and I apply them daily. Many of them have saved my butt. Uncle Bob's videos have some very practical tips and use common sense. It's just this computer scientists paranoia with the strong opinions about the smallest things, like the discussion about tabs vs spaces (<em>use tabs, he he</em>) or removing the curly braces in one-line blocks (<em>don't do it, he he he</em>). See, even I am starting to do it, is contagious. To me, these things look more like <em>conventions</em> than real "<em>laws</em>" we all must follow. At any point, you should use the best tool for the job (<em>even if it's not your favourite</em>).</p>

<p>I think my brain is just damaged by <strong>professional deformation caused by a whole life reading just technical and rigorously-scientific stuff</strong>, in an environment where you had to demonstrate everything you stated and back it up with <strong>huge</strong> amounts of <strong>reliable</strong> and <strong>trustable</strong> data. As Carl Sagan used to say, "<a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Extraordinary_claims_require_extraordinary_evidence"><em>extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence</em></a>". It's only understandable that, <em>for me</em>, these books look like self-help or philosophy books in comparison, which makes them very hard to read, at least to me. And it's not that they are bad books (I repeat, some are worse than others). I don't think many people have this problem. However, there are some good practices and common sense here and there, so I learn stuff from time to time.</p>









<h2>Nice things</h2>

<p>Working from home is amazing. My flat is amazing. My sofa is amazing. My balcony view, and the balcony door, open and injecting oxygen, are amazing. My internet connection is amazing. And, again, THE SILENCE, is amazing.</p>

<p>I also managed to make the Windows partition in my old Mountain work fine again, which means I have Photoshop, Nikon View NX2 and Comic Studio available again. I'M SO HAPPY.</p>

<p>Ubuntu always behaves well and runs as fast and smoothly as usual. <strong>I wish these programs existed for Ubuntu, that way I wouldn't have to waste my time with Windows</strong>.</p>

<p>I just installed Gimp on this Mac and, not only the experience is much worse than in Photoshop, it doesn't react to the pressure of my pen over the tablet. I have to find a way to fix that. But anyway, even if I could manage to load my PS brushes in Gimp, a lot of their transparencies and behaviour are lost in Gimp. I wanted to cry... but now that I fixed the Windows partition, I can go back to Photoshop.</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>I found this amazing infographic about which programming language you should start with</strong>. I started with C, and that's what I recommend everybody, if they really want to understand programming. But the references to Lord of the Rings are amazing! I totally agree with C&#35; being an elf, it's a beautiful language... but instead of living in Rivendell, I would say it lives in Mordor (Windows), and it's a shame it doesn't get out of there.</p>
