<h2>Today I learnt</h2>

<p>It was a strange day, a lot of pairing happened.</p>

<p>Some time ago, the apprentices had a retro with Makis where somebody asked to pair more with craftspeople. And so, today, they were offering to pair with us. And apparently, this is something that is going to happen more often in the future! YAY!</p>

<p><strong>I wanted to pair so badly, but I was VERY behind with my Artisan stories</strong>, so the little-me inside me was crying in the darkest corner of the room in fetal position. However, Dany came to me and say "<em>WE ARE GOING TO PAIR</em>", and apparently, I had no option.</p>

<p>My first and last experience pairing with Dany was that time, months ago, when I asked him to pair on the roman numerals kata, and he was sitting next to me searching for flats, asking me what I thought of them, and leaving his seat to go joke with other people in the office and come back ten minutes later.</p>

<p><strong>This time we were pairing on one of our client's code, so he was focused</strong> and mainly driving the thing. It was a web app that send requests to a server, which would send JSON objects in reply. The requests were questions that had other questions depending on the answer. There were also different types of questions, like reflex questions, yes/no questions or questions to fill in data and all that.</p>

<p>We paired on a spike to show pages in the left sidebar when the JSON sent a group of questions. At the moment, the code was treating groups as questions, so they were shown with the text "reflex", but they should be shown with the question's caption. We made it work, but it was painful for my old octopus eyes to look at huge chunks of JSON display on a single line with no formatting and being able to find anything there. <strong>Apart from that, it was a pretty cool pairing session</strong>.</p>

<p>With Dany comes the music, and at some point he played some pop music, so I had to counter attack with one of my favourite CLASSICS and he had to recognize that he liked the guitars, specially at minute <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pz-UA6rjQ8Q&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=5m50s">5:50</a>. LOL.</p>

<p>Then I saw Jarkyn with <strong>her orgasmic / orthopedic thing</strong> that gives you a back massage that you just can't ignore, and we laughed so hard. The brand (better{B|F}ack) and the kneepads just add to the joke and make it impossible not to see how obvious the whole thing is LOL. IT'S A MINE.</p>

<p><strong>Rabea, Priya and Georgina gave their talk on pairing again</strong>. They didn't know if they should do the kata at the end to show what good pairing is, since our audience was the craftspeople, so I told them to take people from the audience, and they did. Dany and Skim were the chosen ones, and it was a gag show. Also, <strong>Emily gave her studentship talk</strong>. It was short and very Emily like. She told her story and made some nice references. She is going to Africa to visit and decide what to do with her life. I hope she comes back!</p>

<p>Then I found Izaak Rogan, one of Jim's guests, sitting alone, so I felt guilty and asked him to pair. I was super behind with my stories and I had paired with Dany in the morning, so we paired on my Man, the ConMan&trade; , and although he is a JavaScript developer, I really liked how <strong>he was experimenting with the code and asking me questions about the language</strong>. We did some Ruby koans too. At the end, I felt like he did all the typing and I kept talking too much. I probably was a pain in the ass because later on he left without saying goodbye lol.</p>

<p>Later, Sophie came back from talking to Jim, and we paired on ConMan and the Ruby koans as well. I think she is going to ask for a studentship. I'm so happy and I wish she can join us!</p>

<p>After a hard day of getting nothing done, we went to the pub for a well deserved beer.</p>

<p><strong>This has been my best week so far</strong>! But I'm too tired to describe it.</p>

<p>Also, <strong>POODR is one of the best things I've read so far</strong>. Practical, useful, to the point, you won't find long transcriptions of a chat the author had with their friend, pretending they are funny, there's no bragging, just useful concepts and direct language. This book is gold. Also, there were a lot of things that blew my mind. Things that <em>I think</em> are Ruby only, like passing arguments as hashes in a method, so that there is no dependency on the order of arguments, or the number of them.</p>

<p>I also found myself going back to <a href="http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex44.html">Learn Ruby the hard way</a>, which I was following last year in one of the many attempts at learning this compact but confusing language (as seen by a c-like spoiled brain).</p>
