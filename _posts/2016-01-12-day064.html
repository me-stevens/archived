<p>Today we spent the whole day in a different office near Angel, doing a communication workshop. I was a bit afraid that it could be like <a href="{% post_url 2015-12-01-day037 %}">the values workshop</a> we did some time ago. However, I was pleasantly surprised.</p>

<p>I think the other workshop was more focused on <strong>providing a context for us to speak about things</strong>, speak about our values and the values of the company, speak about ourselves, etc. But you couldn't really get anything out of it or the team that you couldn't get from sharing a beer together.</p>

<p>This workshop though, was different. There were several different exercises and from EACH AND EVERYONE OF THEM you could get an interesting learning. And <strong>although the activities were funny and silly, the moral at the end was so DEEP</strong>.</p>




<h2>You do have a life after work, right? RIGHT?</h2>

<p>We started with three groups and we had to make a list of things we had done that our group members didn't know about and didn't do either. I thought I hadn't really done anything interesting in my life, so at first I was so silent. But then, the list was monopolized by Enrique showing off, lol. So, although I was not going to even mention it, I ended up adding "<em>have worked in a particle accelerator</em>" to our list.</p>

<p>When all the groups finished, they read their list aloud and high-fived people from the other groups that had done the same. The list of Felipe's group was also full of Felipe showing off, but at some point there was a "<em>has brown eyes</em>" item, and I laughed SO HARD. It was cool! This activity was just to <strong>find things in our team members that we could relate to, outside of work-stuff</strong>.</p>





<h2>Teamwork = don't monopolize</h2>

<p>Then, we had another very funny activity in which we had to made up a fake story in pairs, and every pair had to follow each other. The learning was that <strong>you should not try to overtake the other person in a conversation, but rather listen to them and support what they say</strong>.</p>

<p>I paired with Jim who decided to start remembering "<em>that time we went to the guitar factory</em>", lol. So I said that they had Jimmy Hendrix guitar, signed by him. And Jim also found David Bowie's. But decided not to buy it because it was too expensive. But then I said that, hey, it's about trade-offs. So he remembered that he sold his house to buy it, and now he was a homeless living under a bridge with Felipe. So I offered the five of them to come stay in my tiny place. But just for two days, because I would get sick. Sick because Jim's kids are sick. And they passed on the infection to the fridge, who was also depressed. So we had to talk to it, because the washing machine wouldn't talk to it, because it was doing its own thing. So we gave the fridge some medication, but it got mixed with the alcohol I store in the fridge. So it fell on the floor and started dropping liquids, and Jim's kids started licking that mix between medication and alcohol. And... time ran out!</p>

<p>Jeez, I wanted to know if Jim's kids survived or not!</p>





<h2>The 10 faces of innovation</h2>

<p>For the next activity, we had to work in pairs, and I was paired with Priya. Everybody was paired with a team member with which they had chemistry. When I heard that Christoph's pair was Felipe, I thought, ok, THIS WAS SETTLED ON PURPOSE, lol.</p>

<p>It was about grading areas of our personality, and then letting our pair to grade us and see if we were delusional. I was delusional, hehehe. Priya thought that I could give myself more points on storytelling (because of my octopus stories) and care-giving (because I prefer to HUG everybody instead of handshaking) than I did.</p>

<p>This activity was aimed at <strong>finding our strengths, and perfecting our weak points</strong>, and also <strong>identifying certain members of the team as better suited for certain types of clients or projects</strong>.</p>





<h2>Communication breakdown</h2>

<p>Then we had to play the roles of a project manager and the developer. The activity consisted on the "project manager" being presented with some abstract figure, and having to describe it to their "developer" pair as accurately as possible. What I received from Priya was something that was super clear and had a lot of details.</p>

<p>We had to draw it, and then compare how much it was similar or not to the original figure. I did two versions, because there was a part that I was not sure about: I had to draw three upside-down triangles horizontally aligned by the base. But what is the definition of base for an upside-down triangle? I thought it was the vertex, so that's how I aligned them. But then, my other version put the three triangles side by side, united by the vertex, which Jarkyn thought it was wild.</p>

<p>The learning was that <strong>even if the explanation is super clear, if you were not in the conversation you can still understand things differently</strong>. In that case, ask the client. It happened to me when Jim suggested me to use enums for my Tic Tac Toe that I didn't know what he meant because I didn't know that you could bind methods to enums! Another interesting thing was that, because Priya knows me well, she was going to use a reference to the backgammon board, but didn't use it because she thought I wouldn't get it. So she was actually thinking on her developer when writing the project's requirements.</p>





<h2>All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy</h2>

<p>We played Chinese whispers with the story of an injury we had, to learn how <strong>details can get ommited or embelished as the message is passed</strong>. We had to tell something we did recently to a pair, without using the letter m, to force us to <strong>think before we talk, and avoid using vocabulary that the other person might not understand</strong> (like using technical language with a non-technical client). We had to say things playing the role of a high-positive/negative and low-positive/negative person and have other team member reply to that...</p>

<p>We had two team members playing the interviewer and interviewee for a job position using those roles, which was very funny. First Amelia asking annoyingly invasive personal questions to Enrique while chasing him with her chair as he was escaping from her. Then CJ being interviewed by Christoph and asking him <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuKwtBtgPPA"><strong>why</strong></a> a lot of times, lol. Then Daniel playing the high negative and Rabea crying like there was no tomorrow, which reminded me of my own crisis I had a couple of months ago. I told her and she asked me if I was too strict or overcritical with myself, because she had been looking at my portfolio and thought I had a load of projects. I seriously think they are too few. But again, there are a lot of things I would like to learn and I haven't yet either.</p>

<p>We also had to tell a story as if we were experts, have the other team members question us, and defend our story. This brought back Uku's memories from talking to clients who would ask questions he didn't know the answer to, but still had to speak and act like an expert.</p>

<p>At the end we had to use all what we learnt during the day to imagine a real case scenario where we had to sell the company (like, sell why we were the best choice) to a very complicated client. We chose Donald Trump and we were meeting him in his tower. The learning was, <strong>that we should shut up more and let the client speak, so that we get to know them better and what they want</strong>. Amelia said that Margaret is such a good sales person because she never speaks of the company, she always speaks of herself, and lets you talk. So, sometimes, Amelia found herself telling Margaret more stuff than she wanted to, hahaha. I want to learn to do what Margaret does.</p>





<h2>Wrapping up</h2>

<p>The organizers of the workshop asked for feedback, and I told them I would like to do more exercises like the last one. Then we went to a pub to have beer and dinner and they joined us! They are so cool, I hope we do something else with them in the future.</p>
