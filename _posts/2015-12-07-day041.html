<h2>Today I learnt</h2>

<p>Christoph talked about learning a new language. He asked us which language were we learning at the moment if any, and what were we doing to learn it. Katas, koans, writing code, etc. started to pop out.</p>

<p>Christoph recommended that we should also <strong>keep an eye on the community</strong>, to learn how they do things. For example, what do people do to start a project in Java? They probably use Maven to generate the folder structure. What do people use to manage Ruby versions and packages? Probably <code class="language-bash">rbenv</code>, and so on.</p>

<p>He also talked about language versions and dependencies. I learnt that you can use two different unit test libraries and that doesn't mean you are bloating your codebase, because tests are not deployed.</p>

<p>The <em>Zagaku</em> finished and I went to learn about the <code class="language-java">Optional</code> class in Java 8. <strong>It's something you would use to avoid null pointer exceptions</strong> when you try to, for example, call a method on an object that hasn't been created yet, or access an element of an array that doesn't exist.</p>

<p>The optional class has a set of methods that allow you to write Java in a more compact way, for example, you don't have to fill your codebase with null checks, because the Optional class takes care of that at compile time, with methods like <code class="language-java">ifPresent()</code>.</p>





<h2>Challenges</h2>

<p>I have to measure the time a story takes me, to learn how to estimate time better. The problem with time estimations is that there are things popping up in this office, interruptions, activities, and what not. And those are totally out of my control. It's not even as estimating a background contribution in your measurement, because backgrounds are more or less well known and can be modeled, and they are usually more or less "constant", i.e. they don't have peaks or surprises. But this office... THIS OFFICE IS SO ALIVE. It would be like trying to model chaos. After all, people still can't predict the weather accurately a month in advance.</p>

<p>Also, Amelia started just shaking hands instead of hugging, and I smelled something like <a href="{% post_url 2015-10-12-day001 %}">what I commented in a previous post</a>. I asked her and she confirmed my suspicion. I would like to STOP the difference we are making between the men and the women in this regard, specially now that these people are starting to become something like friends, or at least, a little family, as Makis calls it. It seriously feels weird to handshake a friend at the office, but then share your life struggles in front of a beer and say good bye with a nice hug. So, if you ask me, I'd rather have all of us hug each other!</p>





<h2>Nice things</h2>

<p>Today, after seeing Jim pretty stressed with calls and going from here to there and from there to here, he stopped for a minute, looked at me, and told me:</p>

<blockquote>"I love my job".</blockquote>

<p>And that was so COOL. So I told him that was COOL, and that not many people can say that. I know he is a man of few words and sometimes it's difficult to read his face, but this time I could see the happiness, right there. And that made me happy, too.</p>
