<p>Today was Friday, and on Friday's I can't get anything done. But today there was another reason to not get anything done.</p>

<p class="center">TODAY WAS THE DAY</p>

<p class="center"><strong>THE DAY WHEN JARKYN BECAME A CRAFTSWOMAN</strong></p>

<p class="center">AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!</p>

<p>And so no apprentice did anything today. We were just too nervous to concentrate in anything. We had lunch and then watched Jarkyn's talk, <strong>which was awesome, very calm, very thought provoking and with a lot of deep messages</strong>. It also had some funny moments and it made me feel relieved to see Jarkyn laugh.</p>

<p>I was as nervous as for Mateu's big day some months ago. <strong>I was up there with her</strong>! After the talk I gave her a huge hug and we went with Rabea, Priya and Sarah for a walk to take some fresh air, have some tea and pastries, and have some good laughs.</p>

<p>When we were back, CJ told us that in Chicago, the whole thing <strong>was actually worse</strong> and you had to wait for much longer. That made me remember what LaToya Allen said <a href="http://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/newbie-story-latoya-allen">when she was interviewed for the CodeNewbie podcast</a> (min 19:30). She thought the challenges were too hardcore and she left the company after one year of apprenticeship to join a product oriented company.</p>

<p>I've been joking with Jarkyn that <strong>the key of her craftsmanship was in my belly, and she had to do a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0432348/mediaindex?ref_=tt_pv_mi_sm">Saw move</a> and cut my belly to get the key</strong>. I did it in order for her to compare that with what she had to do for her challenges and think "<em>This is nothing, compared to killing the squid!</em>". So Georgina asked me if my belly was healing, and I told Jarkyn "<em>Oh, no, I'm alive, you are not gonna pass your challenges!</em>" and we had a good laugh.</p>

<p>We were in this state of excitement and anticipation, we all knew she was in, but anyway, until we heard it from Uku's lips, it wasn't real. <strong>And then he said it. And it was for realz</strong>. The announcement suddenly took some weight out of my shoulders and some pressure out of my chest. It was so relieving! And I fought to contain my manly tears, but I couldn't, so I thought, Fuck it. Welcome happiness manly tears. We've been in a roller coaster the whole fucking day. The whole week!</p>

<p>Anyway, <strong>I had been waiting for this day for so long, and now Jarkyn is finally a craftsperson</strong>, or craftswoman (she said she didn't like the sound of craftsperson).</p>

<p>I'M SO HAPPYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY</p>
