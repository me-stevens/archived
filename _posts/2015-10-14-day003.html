<h2>Today I learnt</h2>
 
<p>That I've been pronouncing Priya's name incorrectly for so long. Why did nobody correct me? I felt so ashamed that I didn't know what to tell her. But at least now I know!</p>

<p><strong>Paul gave another amazing talk about the history of the company</strong>. Jim was his employee number one. They were the first to establish the system of apprenticeship that now everybody seems to be using, and it was in part because Paul started working in the field of education, but then decided that he wanted to write code instead. So he merged both things, in a way. It all makes sense now. I really like what he has built through the years, and his vision for the future. It's so nice to see a person still interested and motivated in their own project after so many years working on it, and willing to continue in the long term.</p>

<p>He complaint that <strong>his university degree didn't taught him what was needed for the real world</strong>. I can not tell you how much I agree with that statement Paul, I feel you. And that, I think, is the reason why so many companies started following this model of teaching their workforce under their wings. Universities just don't get it.</p>

<p>In the round for questions, Jarkyn asked a very interesting one (she always asks the most interesting questions!) about the decision process to choose between all the different ways that may open in front of you as a company. That was a difficult question to answer, and I can totally understand. Decision making is one of the most stressful things one is confronted with in life.</p>

<p>I also learnt how to make coffee in the office's machine. It might sound silly after all the awesome things Paul said, but I'm so used to my old fashioned Italian coffee maker and to just buy the coffee ready to use, that it's so pleasant to me to see the actual grains and know that my coffee is coming from just coffee grains and there's nothing mixed with it.</p>

<p>I'm working on some personal projects (will I ever finish them?) that use JavaScript, and I remembered doing some TDD with Christoph when I visited the office, but didn't remember what we used. Makis suggested I used Jasmine, and Skim suggested QUnit. I think the last one is the one we used. I'll try both and see if I can get my silly brain around them.</p>

<p>Finally, I continued following the TDD by example book and making the exercises, but it's taking me longer that I expected, because I really want to understand and assimilate every part of it, and I'm a very slow reader. So I think I'll start over with the rest of the stories I have to finish this week, while I continue with the book, and I'll probably have to do more of it next week.</p>




<h2>Challenges</h2>

<p>After Paul's talk, Felipe told the residents that we had to <strong>fork a branch of his Tic Tac Toe that was working only for a 3x3 board, and try to make it work for a 4x4 board in just one hour</strong>. If we couldn't make it, we should make a pull request anyway, with whatever we had managed to accomplish. He told us that the important part was the pull request itself, not so much the code.</p>

<p>I paired up with Otto, who hadn't done anything with Java before, and we were scared that in an hour we wouldn't be able to make it work for both a 3x3 and a 4x4 board, so we decided to overwrite what Felipe had for a 3x3 board with the code for a 4x4 board. The cell numbers were hard-coded because that's the easiest solution for a 3x3 board, but we should have changed that to make it work for more general cases, instead of hard-coding the numbers as we did.</p>

<p>Since Otto is a student who hasn't done much with code before, and I'm a resident who has been programming for so long, <strong>I feel it was my responsibility to act cool under pressure and do the right thing</strong>. Instead, I freaked out and delivered something that was working only for one case, when I was given something that was working for all cases. I'm leaving this here to make myself ashamed of me in the future, when I hope I will be a better me and won't do this ugly things. This was a bit of another "earth open up and swallow me in rite nao" situation.</p>

<p>Felipe sat with us and asked us if we would deliver that to a client (the answer was no), and why didn't we do it the right way (the answer was, we couldn't handle the pressure). So, this is a challenge I have to overcome: <strong>to keep cool in times of tight deadlines</strong>.</p>

<p>Which takes me to the next section:</p>




<h2>Things I want to change</h2>

<p>There are many times in my life when I feel a bit like a caveman. Now that I'm in this city where everybody is so elegant, nice and smart, it shows up much more. These are some things I would like to work on in the near future:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Stop being a caveman and <strong>learn some manners</strong>. I'm too spontaneous, this is going to kill me in the future.</li>
	<li>Because I'm a caveman, I fear that sometimes I could have said or done something offensive or just rude. I have to <strong>pay more attention</strong> and watch out.</li>
	<li>Work on my Spanglish, and try to become <strong>as articulate as Jarkyn</strong>, as well as learn how to communicate more accurately in general.</li>
	<li><strong>Stop always trying to say something smart</strong>. I'm not in that world any-more. And I'm not smart, so it takes a huge time to find something smart to say. On top of that, I have to make it sound smart in English, at which I fail miserably. The result of this is that I block, and stay staring at the person in front of me, who is waiting for me to say something, but after all that waiting, I only give them a nervous laugh or make a bad joke. People get bored and don't give second chances! If I don't have anything smart to say, I think it's better to just not say anything.</li>
	<li>Talking about jokes, I have to <strong>stop being the "clown wannabe"</strong> and be more serious. Unless I can think of a very good joke, I should really remember to shut up.</li>
	<li>Despite my efforts of acting as a strong person, I always come out as "cute", because I'm too candid. It's about time to <strong>wise up</strong>.</p>
</ul>

<p>Would these suffice to turn me into a decent person? I'm sure not... but they're a start.</p>





<h2>Things I want to learn</h2>

<p>There are a couple of things that I was trying to find the time to sit and learn before joining the dream team I'm working with now. I plan to find the time to still learn them on my own while I'm a resident. Some of them are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Security:</strong> this is a wide topic, but anything about logins, cookies, authentication, and all the things.</li>
	<li><strong>Ruby and ruby on rails:</strong> This I will learn as a resident for sure.</li>
	<li><strong>The design process of an application</strong>, the decisions, and all that. One of the things I'll like to learn is how to choose the right technology stack for a project.</li>
	<li>Game development. Like <a href="http://www.belenalbeza.com/ludum-dare-33-post-mortem/">this</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Node.js:</strong> I have started doing some of the <a href="nodeschool.io">nodeschool.io</a> workshops, but I want to learn all the quirks, ins and outs.</li>
	<li><strong>Android and iOS application development:</strong> I have seen a bit of Android development this year, but I have never done anything for iOS. Also, I have never used a Mac, so I have no idea how the experience looks like.</li>
</ul>



<h2>Nice things</h2>

<p>Today I discovered that the combination Enrique + Daniel is just too fun to let it go. They almost made me forget how miserable I was feeling after doing what Felipe asked us and failing at life, the universe and everything else.</p>

<p>That, and the fact that I can't have a decent WIFI connection when I am in the small office, will probably make me move to the big office permanently (specially this second reason).</p>
