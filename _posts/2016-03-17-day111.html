<h2>Retro</h2>

<p>I've just pushed my last contribution to the client project I've been working on for the last two weeks, and <strong>I'm a bit sad that everything is over</strong>.</p>

<p>It was pretty intense, and I did shit my pants several times, but it was also cool, and I learnt a lot. Not only about the code, but also about the way we work with clients, which is different to what I've done with clients before. Also, even though I wasn't of much help, it was cool to pair with Christoph and see the way he thinks and solves problems. I hope some of that wisdom sticks with me! I think these have been <strong>the best weeks in the apprenticeship so far</strong>.</p>

<p>Today we had the IPM with the client, and it was great. <strong>I was a bit nervous because today, a story made by me was in there</strong>, but everything went well. We delivered all the points and everything worked as expected. The client was very happy! Christoph was happy! I was happy! Well, I was actually sad because now everything is over, lol. At least for me.</p>

<p>There is still work for at least two weeks more, but I won't be there. The client asked me if I was going to take one point for the next week. That was a bit of a sad moment when we had to say no. When we left, I told her this project had been so cool to work on and that I was so glad to have been part of it, althought my contribution was tiny.</p>

<p>Another cool thing was when <strong>she told us the story of the names of their different staging subdomains</strong>. They are all named after female figures, namely their founders and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Knight">Laura Knight</a>, who was the first woman since 1769 elected to the Royal Academy (in 1936). Reading a bit about her I learnt that she even met none other than George Bernard Shaw, which is RAD.</p>

<p>Christoph asked me what I'm going to do for <em>waza</em> tomorrow, and I haven't think about it yet. I think it's the first Friday that I'm going to have <em>waza</em> time! I will also have the entire weekend to work on my own code projects (yeah, more code, DON'T JUDGE ME OK THNX BYE). And next week I'll be back to the normal apprenticeship.</p>

<p>This feels like finishing the pilgrim's "<em>spirit-ual</em>" way to Santiago de Compostela with my friends, and then saying goodbye to everybody on Sunday at the airport.</p>

<p>But have you noticed what a nice number we have today. 111!</p>
