<h2>Today I learnt</h2>

<p>To turn a day that started very bad, into something better. Today in the morning, something happened that put me in that state that I know so well, where I can not speak to any human, and all mobile phones and internets and all the things should be put far away from me. I did the best I can do in those cases: I applied one of the apprenticeship patterns, "<em><strong>take a break</strong></em>. I went for a walk, to take some fresh air, think about things and not be surrounded by any human who I could potentially shout to or be awful to. Fortunately, that state lasts for a very small bit of time, and then it goes away. It worked, and I prized myself with cookies.</p>

<p>I think I'm starting to get out of the "<em>I am crap</em>" stage that I mentioned in my previous post. At the end of the day I had finally written the Echo Server from the beginning to almost the end, for the fourth time this week. And I managed to do it in more or less tiny steps. Now I have to figure out what's the next tiny step, since I found another complication in the code that I should know how to handle, but I don't. I hope I get some ideas in the shower or in the bus to the office.</p>






<h2>Nice things</h2>

<p>My students from yesterday's Codebar event <strong>sent me an email telling me how much they learnt and had fun</strong>. It was so cute.</p>

<p>At lunch, Priya mentioned something they study in law, where they have to go from the evidence to a conclusion, and all the variables involved in that path to find the truth. I found it so interesting because of its similarity with coding. Would love to see her give a talk on that. I love when people bring their knowledge from other fields and apply it to code, and all the similarities between different fields. I always encourage people to <strong>not focus only in code</strong>, but find other activities they like as well, because <strong>inspiration can come from where you less expect</strong>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Cc1vrvjdY">This talk by Mariko Kosaka</a> is the perfect example of that. JavaScript, knitting, mechanical engineering, history... all that knowledge put together to make an amazing project that turned out to be an inspiring talk.</p>

<p>Also, because of my unintentional break this morning, I lost the Zagaku. Later I learnt they talked about me. AND WELL!! This is an achievement!! (just kidding). Turns out, me entering rooms with a smile in my face, gives people positive energy, so I was used as an example. This is cool, but it also means <strong>I have to work yet harder so that I am used as an example for my coding skills, my projects or my actual contributions</strong>.</p>
