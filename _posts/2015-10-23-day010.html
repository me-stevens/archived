<h2>Today I learnt</h2>

<p>That sometimes it's ok if you are working on a problem or kata <strong>for which you can't infer the next simplest step or do strict TDD</strong>. I did many katas today and yesterday, and my problem still seems to be, what is the next simplest step? and... stop getting carried away by the refactoring! But how to know when I should stop? Christoph told me that it will take time and practice. As with everything, the more experience you have, the best you are at it, and I'm just starting, so I'm hoping this frustration of me not being able to think simple, instead of spitting it all, will go away with time (and many, many katas).</p>

<p>I also don't trust my tests yet. My fear came when changing an <code class="language-java">if</code> for a <code class="language-java">while</code> in a place where it made sense (if I thought about the code at least), but it made me feel insecure about the code really working despite the tests passing. Christoph told me about how <strong>you would normally start testing the edge cases</strong>, for example, a zero in Roman numerals, which doesn't exist, so you could return an empty string for example. That way, you can have the security that your tests are testing everything and if you screw it in the production code, your tests will tell you.</p>

<p>Also, <strong>I paired with Skim for the first time</strong>, and he was very helpful despite not really pairing but more like, trying to help me find the light at the end of the tunnel. He checked the code of one of the katas I've been having trouble with, and detected some code smells that I ended up refactoring to make two tests pass. Then he gave me some advice on where to head next, and told me to think about it as if it was a library.</p>

<p>As I said, I've only been doing TDD for a couple of weeks now. I hope I will get better.</p>







<h2>Nice things</h2>

<p>Today <strong>we had a visitor that made a trip all the way from Brazil to come to our office to see how we work</strong>. We gave him the first lightning talk to present himself and I recognized myself in the way he talked about the company with a smile in his face. He had been following the company for two years and had been blown up by our work ethics, our process, how we focus on good quality code and best practices. It was cool to hear him speak like that.</p>

<p>I helped Priya again with her rehearshal for the talk she is giving tomorrow, when we will be at the Code First Girls conference talking about the company and other things. It was nice to see that she is more secure now, although she still freaks out a little bit about having to speak in front of so many people. I gave her some advice regarding the microphone and audio issues when you are on stage, and that was it. She's gonna do great.</p>







<h2>Challenges</h2>

<p>Today we had <strong>the lightning talks where everybody should speak about something for five minutes</strong>. I couldn't prepare anything, but I found my notes from May, when I attended a flexbox meeting with the editors of the draft through a Skype call of one of the editors (I was in a different country). It was an event where web developers where invited to sit through <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/">the whole flexbox spec</a>, reading every paragraph and testing every example to see if there was any corrections to make, rewording of confusing paragraphs, addition of more examples that we could come up with, and all that. I was able to make two contributions to that spec that where pushed into the draft, which made me very happy.</p>

<p>So I took those notes and I started the talk by introducing the problem that flexbox is solving, but when I started talking about flex, my five minutes ended before I could show the thing in flex that actually solves the problem. I hadn't have the time to practice it so it felt a bit like a "dammit!" moment.</p>

<p>Priya tried to do her 25 minutes talk for her five minutes lightning, which was fun. Georgina talked about something very interesting: why you should not refactor on the backlog, how things can get ugly very fast and how to fix it by trying to focus on finding a clear path through the "dirty" zones instead. Daniel and Skim talked about C and JavaScript, and Cedric, who is coming every Friday, talked about techniques to remember Japanese kanjis. Jarkyn talked about typecasting in Java while a member of the team was watching the talk from Chicago through Skype. Emily gave a talk based on the work she is doing on a farm that ended up with a teaching about life that I really feel attached to and try to practice in my real life: if your life was like a container to fill in, you should get rid of the things that are not important and ask yourself: what do I really care for? what's important? and fill it in with just those.</p>
