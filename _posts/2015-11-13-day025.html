<h2>Today I learnt</h2>


<p>I guess going from Windows to Linux can be painful for a lot of people. However, I am so glad that, more than ten years ago, my previous job introduced me to the open-sourced, free operating system, that gives all the power to the user. I still use Windows for software like Photoshop or Comic Studio. But I'm really waiting for the day when even these will have a Linux version, so that I don't have to use Windows anymore.</p>

<p>That said, can you imagine the opposite? <strong>Today I had to move definitely from Ubuntu to a Mac</strong> (at least for work). It's not as moving from Linux to Windows, which would have been worse (at least Mac is also a Unix-based system!).</p>

<p><a href="{{ '/journal/2015/10/27/day012.html#challenges' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">I had never used a Mac before</a>, but Jim wants me to use one, and everybody in the team uses one. Skim is probably a weird exception, since he uses Linux in a virtual box running on Mac, because he also prefers Linux, but, as he explained to me, Mac is superior in terms of hardware.  Changing from my Mountain to a Mac will also be better for pairing, since the Spanish layout of my laptop's keyboard seemed to be driving everybody crazy.</p>

<p>Jim's old Mac is very similar in specs to my dear Mountain:</p>

<p>The first thing I missed was the terminal. <strong>Mac comes with a terminal, but in Ubuntu, it is a SPACESHIP that makes you feel so powerful</strong>. Mac's term didn't even let me use the <kbd>tab</kbd> key to auto-complete commands! Also, the user experience trolls the user a lot. Like, <strong>when in full-screen mode, the top menu dissapears, and so does the bottom toolbar</strong>. So suddenly, you are at Limbo, and you have to waste precious time hovering the region until said bars appear. The hovering takes time, the appearing too. The solution? Exit full-screen, and resize your window to occupy the whole screen without covering the toolbar. Because there's no such thing as setting something like an "always visible" state for them in Mac. YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS, STEVE JOBS. Y U DO DIS TO US.</p>

<p><strong>Finder also gave me some frustrations, until I discovered that things just had a hide and show state, so I activated "show" on everything</strong>. There's also nothing like <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Baobab">Baobab</a>. Jim showed me how typing <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>spacebar</kbd> would pop a modal search box pop-up where I can type the name of an application to run. But I am more of a tree-view kind of person. I'm all about hierarchies of folders and relationships between files. I like to know what I have installed and where. I want to move through the tree in microseconds. WAT. DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT. I'm a control freak. Ok?</p>

<p>Jim showed me <code class="language-bash">brew</code> as well, which is the equivalent of <code class="language-bash">apt-get</code> in Ubuntu... and doesn't come pre-installed by default! OMG HOW DO PIPOL INSTALL THINGS. He also told me to install <code class="language-bash">cask</code>, so now I install everything through <code class="language-bash">brew cask install whatevah</code>.</p>

<p>Noticing my hardcore-linux-user frustration, Jim told me Mac is a consumer-oriented product, something your grandma would use, so that's why nothing comes pre-installed. But... doesn't that make it like Windows? Ok, maybe not. Windows <em>really</em> treats their users as if they were retarded. But Ubuntu was also created so that it could be used by non-tech-savvy people, and yet it comes with every basic thing. Ah, systems, systems.</p>

<p>As I expected, changing to another system was not straight-forward with bits of frustration, but I decided to <a href="{% post_url 2015-11-10-day022 %}">start being positive</a> and called it a <em>learning curve</em>. Some of the weapons I needed during my battle:</p>

<ul>
	<li><kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Delete</kbd> = <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Delete</kbd></li>
	<li><kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F4</kbd> = <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>W</kbd></li>
	<li><kbd>F5</kbd> = <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> (<a href="http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--OXAwoAgV--/etgub62afz3txuygbukv.gif">WAAA....?</a>)</li>
	<li>Show desktop: <kbd>fn</kbd> + <kbd>F11</kbd></li>
	<li>Cut and paste, or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd> followed by <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd>. Surprisingly, there is no such thing as "cut" in a Mac, you have to copy, and then paste in a <em>special</em> way: <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> followed by <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd></li>
	<li>There's also no right-click. You have to click with two fingers in horizontal position several times until you find the "right" position in the pad that would produce the right-click (I told, you, trolling the user).</li>
	<li>Safari! Aggghhh. I installed Firefox and Chrome and felt like a decent person again.</li>
</ul>

<p>Together with the browsers, I installed everything else I needed like the JVM, IntelliJ, iTerm, which is a decent terminal, Sublime, which is a decent text editor with syntax highlighting (Ubuntu comes with one pre-installed, BTW, mwahhwahwa), a password manager, and all the things.</p>

<p>My expectations are set on Monday to be able to start using this Mac normally and be productive. I guess now I can call myself a hipster. So, that would make me a hippie wannabe hipster with a Mac.</p>

<p>Done with my rant, let's talk about some nice things.</p>









<h2>Nice things</h2>

<p>Today was a calm Friday, since there weren't many guests. Rabea came to the office (she will start working with us on Monday) and we had both Jim and Amelia, as well as Jarkyn, at the office the whole day.</p>

<p>Daniel told us about a project he wants to do with the team. He has noticed that many of us are frustrated by how slow we type, and decided to make a product for the team, that would help us with that, and that will use gamification. There are some sites that do that already, but he thinks they can be improved.</p>

<p>In my case, my slow typing is also related with having a slow brain, so I 'm not sure if doing exercises will help. Anyway, I am excited about us working on a project together. One of the things I wanted to learn is the process of building a product from the beginning to the end, the decisions, the design, the end-users, etc. etc. I don't know if this will be that project, but it seems like a fun start, since it's not something for a client but more for us to play with a toy, and that's much more relaxed.</p>
