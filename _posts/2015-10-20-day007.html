<h2>Today I learnt</h2>

<p>In today's Zagaku, Christoph tried to explain us how to implement the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle">Open-Closed Principle</a> or OCP, where <strong>you write your code in a way that your classes are open to extension but close to modification</strong>. This means that you don't have to modify the code you have already written if you want to add new features (close to modification), you just add them, which means, you write new code (open to extension).</p>

<p>It reminded me of the blog post <a href="https://blog.8thlight.com/dariusz-pasciak/2015/05/28/alternatives-to-boolean-parameters.html">Alternatives to boolean parameters</a> by 
Dariusz Pasciak, which is not exactly about the OCP in particular, but the solution it proposes to his problem follows this principle. I found the example to be so good when I first read it because you always hear about all these concepts, but never see them implemented with a clear example.</p>

<p>After the Zagaku I paired with him and <strong>finally solved the roman numerals kata</strong>. It's such a simple kata, and yet I had it all screwed up because I can't seem to be able to think in a simple way. When Christoph changed the <code class="language-java">if</code> condition with a simple <code class="language-java">while</code>, I was like, BOOM! Just a convenient <code class="language-java">while</code> placed in the right place at the right moment, <em>while</em> I was trying to write stupid methods that didn't work. Why can't I grasp these simple solutions? What happens to my brain? Anyway, I was so happy that I gave him a huge hug. I really have to learn to think the right way or I will kill myself.</p>

<p>I spent the rest of the day trying to do the codewar katas and trying to think simple. But I think I screwed my kata again. I didn't finish it, so I'll try to make it work tomorrow. I'm going to use very single minute I have to make katas as if there was no tomorrow. <strong>I'm gonna practice, practice, practice!</strong>.</p>





<h2>Challenges</h2>

<p>When I was still not sure that I was coming to work with these beautiful people, <strong>I signed to a lot of online courses</strong> (for example, in <a href="https://www.edx.org/">edx</a>), and now I am receiving mails from them asking me for my homework and stuff we have to deliver. I barely have any time left after coming from the office, having dinner, a shower, and writing this apprentice blog, so I'll have to find a way to do it all. I will handle, I will conquer.</p>



<h2>Nice things</h2>

<p>Today <strong>we helped Priya with her rehearsal for the talk she has to deliver this Saturday in Code First Girls</strong>. We listened to her and made suggestions of little things she could polish, although there really was very little to improve. Priya is such a good public speaker, even if she feels nervous about it. The audience is going to be bigger than anything she has spoke in, so I totally understand her.</p>

<p>We ended up thinking of questions people could ask her, and I recommended her to record herself to practice, because recording yourself makes you feel like you are observed, and also, you can watch yourself from the audience's perspective and see and correct things that you don't like more easily.</p>

<p>Also, the apprentices had to share our experience as residents, what we liked and suggestions for improving, with Makis, who had been given the task of looking after us and checking that we were fine and we didn't need anything. We all agreed that there are so many events going on, that we sponsor or help with, and it is only going to get bigger, so we need a bit of organization in that respect.</p>






<h2>Other</h2>

<p>Days are passing by so fast at the office, hours fly, and my brain is not going at the same speed. I hope in this first month that is already half pass, I can develop all the skills that Jim and the team want me to develop and that I can be ready in six months to become a craftsperson.</p>
