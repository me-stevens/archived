<p>Or ruler of the world. In general.</p>

<p>I don't know what to write today because I am confused about something that happened yesterday. It was very sad. But in a sense, I'm so happy it happened. It's good to know about these things, and I'm a fan of transparency and honesty.</p>

<h2>Nice things</h2>

<p>Talking to Amelia was the highlight of the day. I've seen things happening, and I didn't want to make a big deal out of them (when something happens, I just act). Anyway, <a href="{% post_url 2015-10-12-bigBang %}">I've said it before</a>, I'm so happy that Amelia is in the team. She is like common sense on legs.</p>
