<h2>Today I learnt</h2>

<p>That I am getting old! Oh my, how did I manage to work 16 hours non-stop in the ol' days? I can't any more. I found myself getting tired more easily.</p>

<p>This morning I pushed through a dumb body who was trying to keep me away from what I enjoy the most: writing code. First, it tried with pains. Pains everywhere. Then it tried crying out of frustration, so I couldn't see what I was writing. Then it tried boiling my blood for the stupidest things and making me loose my temper. And through all that I went, and got out victorious. Sometimes you gotta show 'em who is in charge. But it's difficult! My body and my brain are, sometimes, my worst enemies. It took me an entire morning to do something so straight forward, something I know I could have pulled in a couple of hours ten years ago.</p>

<p>Anyway, life is good, the future is bright, and thanks to Skim, I learnt about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)#Recursion_versus_iteration">the difference between recursion and iteration</a>.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in my IPM, Jim advised me not to use a recursive method for the <code class="language-java">run()</code> method of my <code class="language-java">EchoServer</code> class, but use a loop instead. I was curious about the differences in performance between a recursive method that goes on forever or an infinite loop.</p>

<p>Recursion <strong>creates a new stack every time the function is called</strong>, and that could cause a stack overflow if my user kept typing things forever that were not <code class="language-java">"exit"</code>. A loop keeps everything in one stack, so you could never have a stack overflow (you could have other problems though, if you had an infinite loop).</p>





<h2>Nice things</h2>

<p>Priya told me that HeadSpace was organizing a <strong>free yoga class for Tuesdays</strong>, here in the meetings room, and suggested me to join. It was at 18:30 and it felt so great. I'm so happy that she let me know, I really needed it today!</p>

<p>Emily came to the office with another interesting story to tell. <strong>She visited a prison</strong>, because she is in some kind of charity, and I think I understood she was helping with the food. So she met the prisoners that cook for the rest of the prison gang. She learnt from them that they are so isolated from the external world, that any activity they do inside the prison, they do it in a very focused way. She said she also came with a new appreciation for freedom and liberty. I think there are so many things we are lucky to have that we take for granted</p>
