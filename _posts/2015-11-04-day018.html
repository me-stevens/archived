<h2>Today I learnt</h2>

<p>That <strong>I should not spent more that 15-20 minutes sketching the design of my application</strong>. Because the tests are going to change everything anyway!</p>

<p>When I first deigned my Tic Tac Toe, I spent a lot of time thinking about the classes I would need, the responsibilities of each, the collaborators, even the methods and fields I would need! Not only all that changed from the moment I started sketching until I (thought I) had the final design, but also when I started to code, many things changed.</p>

<p>However, I do think sketching on a piece of paper helps me write code with less bugs. At least in those days when I knew nothing about TDD. And it also helps me visualise things more clearly and organize the classes.</p>

<p>I spent the whole afternoon doing this:</p>

	<figcaption>The final sketch. It took me the whole afternoon to arrive there.</figcaption>

<p>It changed a lot from what I started with, but I needed to do it. Next time, I'll try to do it in less time.</p>







<h2>Nice things</h2>

<p>Wednesday! And that means... Codebar! Again with my student of the previous Wednesday, and again with happy ending (I hope!).</p>

<p>Going there was nice because <strong>Priya showed me the SOHO</strong>, a famous neighbourhood here. And in the way back home, <strong>Emily showed me China Town</strong>, which was all decorated due to a recent visit from the president of China. A lot of food shops and restaurants with baked dogs (and even one of my race, a squid!) hanging from the windows. And a lot of beautiful red lamps hanging from cables crossing the streets.</p>

<p>I haven't seen much of this city yet, after so many weeks, because I am either googling Java functions or finishing my stories. I would take less work on my stories, but I don't want to slow down. So it's nice to have these little excuses to explore the town!</p>
