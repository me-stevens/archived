<h2>Today I learnt</h2>

<p>I had my flat's annual gas check today in the morning so <strong>I missed the OSOM <em>Zagaku</em> about how to juggle</strong>, but I saw pictures that Georgina showed me on her phone, and it looked like a lot of fun.</p>

<p>So my IPM was moved to the afternoon. Jim was caught in phone calls so it was Christoph and me again. I had a huge curiosity regarding which would be my tasks for this week, since, for me, ConMan&trade; was finished. But <strong>I got a sequel to it: I have to use SQL</strong> instead of file storage (see what I did there?).</p>

<p>Christoph recommended to use something simple like SQLite. So the first thing I checked is if I had sqlite installed already:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">$ sqlite3
SQLite version 3.8.10.2 2015-05-20 18:17:19
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
Connected to a transient in-memory database.
Use ".open FILENAME" to reopen on a persistent database.
sqlite> .exit
$
</code></pre>

<p>This is the SQLite command prompt where you can type commands or SQL statements. If you want to run sqlite against a database, you can also pass it as an argument:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">$ sqlite3 test.db
SQLite version 3.8.10.2 2015-05-20 18:17:19
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite> .exit
$
</code></pre>

<p>I worked with SQLite last year, but we didn't build anything with it, just did exercises where we typed commands on the prompt against a test database, to see things happening. Also, we didn't use SQL, we used HQL.</p>

<p>We used it only for a couple of weeks and never touched it again. So, to refresh my memory, I skimmed through this <a href="http://zetcode.com/db/sqlite/">SQLite tutorial</a> and the official docs for the <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/cli.html">Command Line Shell For SQLite</a>.</p>


<p>What I have to learn now though, is <strong>to connect to an SQLite database through Ruby</strong>. So I followed this <a href="http://zetcode.com/db/sqliteruby/">SQLite Ruby tutorial</a>, and had SO MUCH FUN.</p>

<p>Apparently, I also had the <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/sqlite3/versions/1.3.11">sqlite3</a> gem installed:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">$ pry
[1] pry(main)> gem-list
...
sqlite3 (1.3.7)
...
[2] pry(main)> quit
$
</code></pre>

<p>Which is used in the following way:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">require 'sqlite3'

db = SQLite3::Database.new "data.db" 

db.execute "SELECT * FROM table" do |row|
  p row
end

db.close
</code></pre>

<p>You first require the gem and then create a new SQLite object that takes the name of the file where you want the database to be stored (in this case, <code class="language-">data.db</code>). Then you can do a lot of stuff with it, like executing SQL statements by calling the <code class="language-ruby">execute</code> method. A resource I found pretty handy is the documentation of the <a href="http://sqlite-ruby.rubyforge.org/sqlite3/classes/SQLite3/Database.html#M000099">Database</a> class, it shows you everything you can do with it.</p>

<p>The good thing is that, <strong>it comes with an in-memory implementation</strong>, that you can use very easily by passing <code class="language-ruby">":memory:"</code> instead of the file name:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">db = SQLite3::Database.new ":memory:"</code></pre>

<p>So I can use it for tests, and then in the production code I pass a real file. Also, this is more like SQL stuff, but, I will need to create a contacts table at some point, but it should only be created once, so I will need:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">db.execute "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tablename(Id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, columnname TEXT)"</code></pre>

<p>I will also need to insert and update rows, to add and update contacts.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">db.execute "INSERT INTO tablename(column1, column2) VALUES ('value1', 'value2')"
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">db.execute "UPDATE tablename SET column1='value1', column2='value2' WHERE id=1"
</code></pre>

<p><strong>The ids are incremented automatically</strong> but can also be inserted by hand. There is also <code class="language-sql">INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT</code>, which uses a slightly different algorithm for id creation, but <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/autoinc.html">its use is not recommended</a>.</p>

<p>You can prepare SQL statements to use later, and when you execute them, you get a cursor. Just as I remember doing it in Java:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">stm = db.prepare "SELECT * FROM Cars LIMIT 5" 
rs = stm.execute 

rs.each do |row|
  puts row.join "\s"
end
</code></pre>

<p>You can also do it in a one-liner:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ruby">rows = db.execute "SELECT * FROM Cars LIMIT 5"</code></pre>

<p>You can <strong>get the results as a hash</strong>, by specifying:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">db.results_as_hash = true</code></pre>

<p>I thought this was so convenient for ConMan&trade;, but it is not, because what it does is, that it returns duplicated information: <strong>the first keys are the names of the columns, and the last keys are numbers from 0 to the number of columns, both pointing to the same values</strong>.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">require 'sqlite3'

  db = SQLite3::Database.open "test.db"
  db.results_as_hash = true

  ary = db.execute "SELECT * FROM Cars LIMIT 5"
  puts ary

  db.close

end
</code></pre>

<p>would return:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">{
	"Id"=>1, 
	"Name"=>"Audi", 
	"Price"=>52642, 
	0=>1, 
	1=>"Audi", 
	2=>52642
}</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure why they decided to implement it this way, but it means I can't use it.</p>

<p>Another thing I remembered from Java is that you can pass parameters. <strong>Binding parameters guards the program against SQL injections, and automatically escapes some special characters</strong>, which allow them to be handled correctly:</p>


<pre><code class="language-ruby">stm = db.prepare "SELECT * FROM Cars WHERE Id=?"
stm.bind_param 1, id
rs = stm.execute
</code></pre>

or 

<pre><code class="language-ruby">stm = db.prepare "SELECT * FROM Cars WHERE Id = :id"
rs = stm.execute id
</code></pre>

or the one liner

<pre><code class="language-ruby">row = db.get_first_row "SELECT * FROM Cars WHERE Id = ?", id</code></pre>

<p>You can also use <strong>transactions</strong>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">require 'sqlite3'

begin
    
    db = SQLite3::Database.open "test.db"

    db.transaction
    db.execute "DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Friends"
    db.execute "CREATE TABLE Friends(Id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, Name TEXT)"
    db.execute "INSERT INTO Friends(Name) VALUES ('Tom')"
    db.execute "INSERT INTO Friends(Name) VALUES ('Rebecca')"
    db.commit
    
rescue SQLite3::Exception => e 
    
    puts "Exception occurred"
    puts e
    db.rollback
    
ensure
    db.close if db
end
</code></pre>

<p>Although I haven't looked into it much further.</p>

<p>I think I have more or less an idea of what I have to do, what I can use and how can I add it to ConMan&trade;. What I don't know is how am I gonna screw it up this time.</p>
