<p>Today was the last day of the talks at <a href="https://hacksummit.org/">Hack Summit</a>. This is a virtual event for developers, like a streamed conference, where a bunch of rock stars are invited to give talks through Google Hangouts from the comfort of their home or office, and people from any part of the world can connect and listen to them.</p>

<p>There are several reasons why I like this conference. First off, it's non profit, and <strong>you can donate to a list of other non-profits they support</strong>, which are normally related to activities regarding integration of discriminated groups.</p>

<p>Second, <strong>you don't need a budget to travel there to see the talks</strong>, you only need an Internet connection.</p>

<p>Third, <strong>it's very interactive</strong>. There is a chat on 24h, there are polls done in real time during the talk, and the attendants can ask questions in real time too, which get voted, and then Ed goes through them during the talk or at the end.</p>

<p>Fourth, <strong>if you are a speaker, you also don't need a budget</strong> or anything, because you can give your talk on your pajamas.</p>

<p>Fifth, <strong>no pictures</strong>! I hate this habit of people taking pictures of you without your permission, just so that they can upload them to TWITTER.</p>

<p>Six, <strong>no room for harassment</strong>. Although they don't have a code of conduct in place, women can attend remotely, without being exposed to harassment, or simply join the chat under a pseudonym that hides their gender if they want to, so that they can speak freely without being judged or taken for somebody's girlfriend or secretary, etc.</p>

<p>One thing I noticed in the 2014 sessions was that, <strong>for female speakers, most of the comments were about their looks and not about the contents of the talk</strong>. I remember Trisha Gee's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyEdy-l5608">cafelito talk</a>. That was the first time I saw her building that app in an hour with all that bunch of technologies. And at some point, somebody in the chat had to jump and say STAPH IT, KIDS, because the comments were starting to get embarrassing. Now imagine the situation if the conference was not virtual but in person.</p>

<p>What a cross to bear daily, <strong>just for the sake of having been born with the wrong genitals</strong>. Even if you are as rad and bad-ass as a developer as she is.</p>

<p>Anyway, I discovered this conference on 2014 and I hope they continue doing it!</p>

<p>Apart from that, today I worked from home because I was not feeling well. But I managed to finish a draft of the notes for the <em>Zagaku</em> I have to present next week!</p>
