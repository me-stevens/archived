<h2>Today I learnt</h2>

<p>Yesterday in my IPM Jim told me <strong>to work with Christoph for the next two weeks in his client projects</strong>, so I'm going to be "his shadow" these days. Which is super cool, because one of his projects is a Ruby on Rails site that we have to update, and the other is a C++ project involving a Raspberry Pi and the Qt Creator IDE. HOW COOL IS THAT. SPARKLES.</p>

<p>Some time ago I wanted to leave PHP aside for a while and try out "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5EIrSM8dCA"><em>that Ruby on Rails thing</em></a>" everybody was talking about. But for that I had to learn Ruby first. So I never reached Rails, <strong>because every time I sat to try to learn Ruby, the language didn't make any sense to me</strong>. My brain was already damaged by so many years of C-like languages.</p>

<p>My experience learning Ruby in the apprenticeship was much better, and I think I am making some progress, although it is mega slow. And now, I am working on a Ruby on Rails project! who would have thought. If the "me" from the future had told me this one year ago, I wouldn't believe the crazy squid.</p>

<p>Very timely, <strong>this weekend was "free weekend" in <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/">CodeSchool</a>, so they had all their courses for free</strong>. I would have gone through them all, but there was not enough time, so I just downloaded all the videos from the advanced git course, iOS development, what's new in ECMA6, Python, Ruby on Rails, Rspec and Rails testing, and SQL. So this week I'm trying to find time <strong>to watch at least the Ruby on Rails videos</strong>. I would also watch the CofeeScript videos, but Christoph says that with ECMA6 they will probably not use it anymore.</p>

<p>So yesterday we finished two stories regarding a banner that was not showing for users visiting the site with an ad-blocker, because some module had the word "ad" in it, and we fixed button-triggered-navigation that was not working in a couple of buttons in which somebody forgot to add some data attributes.</p>

<p>They also have a shared GitHub repo with the assets of the page, because apparently they are used in other internal apps as well. But that was making our life a bit difficult. I remember some time ago when I wanted to find out how to group my GitHub repos by some common criteria, I found that was done with shared repos, but I never used them because they seemed to be a pain in the ass. Turns out they are!</p>

<p>We managed to make two pull requests, although today we weren't as lucky. <strong>The codebase is huge and if we want to change something, we have to change a lot of files</strong>. If I had to add a feature there, I wouldn't know what to touch. So we were making one of those kind of changes, and the little over-complicator inside me suggested something that made us waste some precious time. Our time for the story ran out and we have to continue tomorrow.</p>






<h2>Nice things</h2>

<p>Yesterday, Rabea gave a <em>Zagaku</em> about flexbox, and it was cool. She knows how to turn everything into a party of laughs! And she covered almost everything with nice examples. Then, after her talk, I made the nerdiest love declaration to Jarkyn with <a href="http://i.imgur.com/MLiDT.gif">the 128&radic;e980 trick</a>.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, Priya came to say goodbye to the small office, and with her natural charm she said:</p>

<blockquote>What are you two troublemakers up to?</blockquote>

<p>I was ROFL.</p>

<p>Today Jarkyn finished receiving feedback from her challenges, so she is going on vacation now, for this and next week. Well deserved, and she will be missed!</p>
