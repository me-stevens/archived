<p>Not a lot to say today. <strong>Amelia is going to start a studentship!</strong> She is a craftsperson already, but she 
did her apprenticeship in administration. She is always taking care of everybody in the office or taking care of her kids, so now she wants to do this for herself. Well deserved I would say! I'm so happy about the news.</p>

<p>Also, today I made what I think is my last pull request for ConMan&trade;. Yes, you always come back to your projects and change things here and there. But now I think it's finished.</p>

<p>So, as a farewell, <strong>I changed the author of the last commit, so that it appeared to be made by Matz himself</strong>. You could click on the commit and it would show you the code, and if you clicked on Matz's avatar it would bring you to Matz profile page on GitHub.</p>

<p>I thought my dear team members would catch the prank immediately, but they fell! Until I told Rabea it was me, and she menaced to call "<em>the Open Source Police</em>", or OSP. We were ROFL.</p>

<p>That was it for today, tomorrow more and better.</p>
