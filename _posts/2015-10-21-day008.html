<h2>Today I learnt</h2>

<p>About the math behind relational databases. Daniel walked us through n-tuples and datasets, and the relations between them. I have worked with SQL before, but didn't know the origin of the <code class="language-sql">SELECT</code> clause (selection rules), the <code class="language-sql">WHERE</code> clause (projection), all the <code class="language-sql">JOIN</code>s and so on. He even pointed out <a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~zives/03f/cis550/codd.pdf">a paper</a> that apparently is very famous among computer scientists. Of course I hadn't heard of it before, so I'll be happy to sit and read through it when I have the time, and see if I can be able to exract the different parts of the SQL language that are based on the concepts developed there.</p>




<h2>Challenges</h2>

<p><strong>I'm afraid I haven't yet found the way to do things in simple steps and I keep overcomplicating the simplest problems</strong>. Today I was battling with a kata that I just started yesterday, just because I got into a rabbit hole and couldn't get out. I think I'm gonna forget about it for a while and do something else, and then maybe come back to it from scratch and with a fresh mind.</p>

<p>I paired with Priya and we finished the kata that we started yesterday, before I could screw it up. I had already started overcomplicating it, but Priya was able to stop me and direct things through a diferent course. <strong>I guess I just want to spit everything I know, because I already know the solution, and I'm so used to just write a lot of code</strong>. Tomorrow I'll keep doing katas and wait for that moment of enlightment when I grasp the knowledge on "how to think small".</p>



<h2>Nice things</h2>

<p>Today was codebar's second birthday, and also the day that Martin Mc Fly was Back from the future (apparently the real year), so it was cool to be back at the Shutl to be a mentor, this time in JavaScript, with two students that I was able to (I hope so) keep enlightened and astonished at their achievements and at other people's JavaScript on codepen, for example Ana Tudor's demos, whose code I recommended to read. We ended up seeing also some CSS animations and even writing a bit of code for them.</p>
