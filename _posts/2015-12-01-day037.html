<h2>Today I learnt</h2>

<p>Dave had two possible topics prepared for today's <em>Zagaku</em>, so he asked if we wanted something about technical skills or soft skills, and we all agreed on the technical skills. So he talked about libraries versus frameworks, THE ULTIMATE BATTLE.</p>

<p>He took a strong position, <strong>libraries are better</strong>, and explained why. Basically:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Libraries solve problems faster: tests in frameworks need to load the whole framework in memory.</li>
	<li>Frameworks are opinionated and dictate the structure to use. If there is a change/update to the framework you have to update your whole code.</li>
	<li>Frameworks require "<em>Tribal Knowledge</em>" (I loved that expression), you need to know how the whole framework works in order to use it.</li>
	<li>In a library, the coder defines the conventions. In a framework, is the other way around.</li>
	<li>In summary, libraries are easier to extend, read and debug.</li>
</ul>

<p>After reading Uncle Bob's post on the open-closed principle yesterday, <strong>I would say libraries are very similar to plug-ins</strong>, only that plug-ins know about your codebase while your codebase doesn't know about them, and with libraries they are the ones who don't know about your code.</p>

<p>In other topics, looks like <a href="https://blog.8thlight.com/dariusz-pasciak/2015/05/28/alternatives-to-boolean-parameters.html">Dariusz post about the Printer class</a> and how it implemented OCP was not exactly right in that assertion and it was confusing me. It really doesn't implement OCP, although he literally says that "<em>the Printer class is closed for modification</em>". But every-time he wants to add a different printer, he has to go and modify the Printer class, and that means recompiling and redeploying it. Which is the actual state of my Menu class.</p>





<h2>Challenges</h2>

<p>Today we had the core values event, where we got the results of that test that we did some weeks ago. For each of the values, we obtained a ranking score that went <strong>from 0 to 5 or 6</strong> as much. I got as top values "<em>Commerce</em>", with a score of 201 and "<em>Manage</em>" with 36.</p>

<p>WAIT. WUT</p>

<p>COMMERCE. 201 points.</p>

<p>TWO HUNDRED AND ONE POINTS...</p>

<p>...commerce.</p>

<p>Even Makis was like "<em>WAAAA... ?</em> Turns out I thought "1" was the lowest punctuation and "4" was the highest when I valued the values, Don't they have tests for the tests? I want to think at least the person who calculated my scores must had a big WTF face. So that's why commerce was poping up for like 80 questions, despite me scoring it with a 1, and I was like HEY TEST YOU'RE NOT GETTING IT, YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME, I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.</p>

<p>We had to play a dynamic where we worked in trios and I had to sit with Makis and Uku. The dynamic consisted in each of us taking one of <strong>three roles: participant, facilitator and observer</strong>, and then rotating. The "participant" had to go through their core-values result and tell a story about them. But the "facilitator" and the "observer" descriptions were very similar! So I took the initiative and acted as a facilitator for Uku first and then as an observer for Makis, and kept them talking by asking them questions. That way, time could run out before I had to talk, <em>mwehwehwehehehe</em>. AND IT DID.</p>

<p>WAT. I'M VERY BAD AT THESE THINGS OK. I'M A NERD LEAVE ME ALONE.</p>

<p>I really admire these people who work with people on a daily basis and <strong>they have all this abstract vocabulary and expressions and are able to connect abstract relations between the concepts</strong>, so that three values that for me are exactly the exact same value, for they have all kind of subtleties, nuances and differences.</p>

<p>I can't express myself like that. And I had screwed my scores anyway. So for the second activity, where we had to present ourselves to the rest of the team and turn our most valued values into conceptual drawings, I just threw away the whole values thing and talked from my guts.</p>

<p>We were given a mega-big piece of paper, and I divided it into the four sections they asked for: <strong>relational values, being values, doing values and role values</strong>, and spoke my heart out. Although I think I couldn't make my point come across clearly. I really suck at this abstract communication!</p>









<h2>Nice things</h2>

<p><strong>I already started reading the Hacking book</strong>, and I have to agree with Nathan, it has one of the best introductions to C I have seen. If only I had something like this when I learnt C like 20 years ago!</p>
