<p>In "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surely_You%27re_Joking,_Mr._Feynman!">Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!</a>", one of the stories is about Feynman being called by the government to give his opinion on the security of the yet to be build Oak Ridge plant.</p>

<p>In this story, he tells how he was presented with blueprints of the design of the plant, and he had no idea how to read those, specially the symbols on them.</p>

<p>One of those symbols called his attention, because he didn't know what it could be, but it was all over the place. He thought it could be a window, but because of where they were placed in the blueprint, he doubted.</p>

<p>He wanted to ask the guys who were explaining the whole thing to him, but he waited a bit because, maybe they would be going to explain it in a couple of minutes, right?</p>

<p>But they never explained what those symbols were, they kept on explaining other things. And so this happenned: (quote from the book):</p>

<blockquote>You must have been in a situation like this when you didn’t ask them right away. Right away it would have been OK. But now they’ve been talking a little bit too long. You hesitated too long. If you ask them now they’ll say "What are you wasting my time all this time for?"</blockquote>

<p>This paragraph is one of my favourites in the book. How many times has that happenend to me? How many times has that happened to you?</p>

<p>At the end, he solves it by magically having the idea that those symbols could probably be the valves they are talking about. The valves that can't get stuck because that would be a serious security issue. So he points randomly at one of the valves and asks "What happens if this valve gets stuck?" With the stupid luck that the exact valve he was pointing to was the origin of the problem they were tracking.</p>

<p>This, as all the stories in the book, is a hilarious one. But it's not what happens in real life. So, if you are not following, if you don't understand, ask questions, and ask them soon.</p>

<p>Also, never commit or push code at the end of the day, when you are tired and blurry.</p>
