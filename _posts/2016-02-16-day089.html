<p>Today I more or less finished the SQLite implementation of the ConMan&trade; database, but I'm afraid that it was too simple and is going to be wrong. I still haven't implemented <a href="http://modocache.io/shared-examples-in-rspec">shared examples</a>, and I also didn't take into account <a href="http://compgroups.net/comp.lang.ruby/tutorial-tdd-for-sqlite3-ruby/742114">transactions</a>.</p>

<p>Also, I paired with Jarkyn, which was cool, as she has to pair with everybody in the team before she receives her challenges. She gave me some ideas that I am going to try out tomorrow. But now I'm too tired to write more.</p>
