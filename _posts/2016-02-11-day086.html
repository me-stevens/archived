<p>Today I couldn't get any job done.</p>

<p>Because, today...</p>

<p>is the day...</p>

<p>when the course of human history will be bent.</p>

<p>Today is...</p>

<p class="center">GRAVITATIONAL WAVES CONFIRMATION DAY</p>

<p>I've been honestly trying to concentrate on work, but I can't. Everytime I go back to Vim to practise the coin changer kata to present this Friday (tomorrow!!) my mind goes back to <strong>all the possibilities of the things that we will able to see from now on that we don't even know exist, that we can't even imagine, conceive inside our brains</strong>.</p>

<p>I've also been feeling <strong>very lonely</strong>, because I want to talk about it and I have nobody to talk to. People ask me what impact would that have in their lives... well, none. Not on you as an individual, your life won't change. But the human race!</p>

<p>Priya and Amelia were so nice to show some interest, and kept asking me questions and wanting to know more. Skim and James also listened to me for a bit. But it was so frustrating to not being able to explain how cool this measurement is. <strong>I can't fit inside myself</strong>. We can measure gravitational waves, that's it, we're done. Once you open that door, it is open for ever.</p>

<p>I'm not going to do a better job at explaining it than others have done already, so I'll just leave some resources here:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The first rumours before the announcement day included articles like "<em><a href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/dark-star-diaries/why-you-should-be-excited-about-this-week-s-big-ligo-announcement/">Why You Should Be Excited about This Week's Big LIGO Announcement</a></em>", from Scientific American, and "<em><a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2076754-latest-rumour-of-gravitational-waves-is-probably-true-this-time/">Latest rumour of gravitational waves is probably true this time</a></em>", from New Scientist.</li>
	<li>Jorge Chan made <a href="http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1853">an awesome video</a> explaining what gravitational waves are and why measuring them is so important.</li>
	<li>The <a href="http://www.ligo.org/news/media-advisory.php">press conference announcement</a> in the LIGO official site and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEPIwEJmZyE">press conference announcement video</a>, which is online on YouTube. I wanted to watch it online as it was happening. So madly. But I had to Vim. BUT IT IS ONLINE. With Kip Thorne and Gaby Gonzalez.</li>
	<li>The peeps from Scientific American wrote <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/gravitational-waves-discovered-from-colliding-black-holes1/">quite a comprehensive article</a> with videos and all, which is quite nice in my opinion.</li>
	<li>Then Emily Lakdawalla, a planetary geologist that I also follow on twitter, published <a href="https://soundcloud.com/emily-lakdawalla/ligochirp">an excerpt of the conference with the chirp</a> for everybody to enjoy. That's the sound of two black holes colliding. How cool is that.</li>
	<li><a href="http://time.com/4217920/discovery-gravitational-waves-science/">The Times</a> also published a nice article about the confirmation implications.</li>
</ul>

<p>I contacted Nicky, the plasma physicist, through Codebar's slack, but he didn't show as much excitement. <strong>I've never felt so happy and so alone at the same time</strong>.</p>
