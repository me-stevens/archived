<h2>Today I learnt</h2>

<p>Today I had to perform the coin changer kata in front of everybody. Yesterday, at lunch, I told Christoph that I wanted to do it after stand-up, because I was shitting my pants. And he said:</p>

<blockquote>
- No way. We do it after lunch.<br>
- BUT...!<br>
- Nope.
</blockquote>

<p>And Mateu said that everybody does it, so, I had no option. I asked if there were going to be any visitors, and thanks god, budda and mahoma, there weren't any.</p>

<p>The funny thing is, that we finished lunch and everybody went to do their stuff, and I forgot about it until Mateu asked me:</p>

<blockquote>Didn't you have to perform your kata today after lunch?</blockquote>

<p>So I did it, and it went well. This is some of the feedback I got after:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Dany was surprised of the way the IDE (IntelliJ) allows you to write code (he uses Vim), in the sense that I was writing in a certain way because I knew the IDE will generate certain code automatically. That, of course, makes me go much faster, but he writes the whole thing manually (but he also types faster than me anyway, so...).</li>
	<li>Georgina and Christoph mentioned that I was using my mouse too much, and Georgina offered to pair to show me some shortcuts.</li>
	<li>I was so concentrated in repeating the kata the way I knew it was going to work, that at some point I typed "<code class="language-java">&lt;</code>" instead of <code class="language-java">6</code>, The test was of course red, and I continued adding tests (later on I realized and I changed it).</li>
	<li>At some point I had to add <code class="language-java">Arrays.asList(5, 5)</code> as the change for <code class="language-java">10</code>, and that made people wonder a bit, but I had alerted them in advance and later on I changed it to <code class="language-java">Arrays.asList(10)</code> and it made sense.</li>
</ul>

<p>When we finished Christoph asked me: "<em>Relieved?</em>" and I was like: "<em>YEEEEEEESSSSSSSHHHHHH...!</em>".</p>

<p>Last thing I have to say is, I am forever thankful to Jarkyn. I didn't like the fact that I was arriving to the algorithm too fast, because I introduced the for loop first and then the while. She sat with me while I showed her what was I doing, and she helped me break it down into smaller steps, by introducing first the while loop and then the for loop. As a result, my kata process to reach the answer was so BIUTIFUL AND SHINY, and it made much more sense.</p>

<h2>Nice things</h2>

<p>Today was the company's Kick's off, so we had talks by everybody in Chicago, and Jim also recorded himself in video to sent there and reproduce. His talk was great, as were the others, but at some point around 20:00 people started to fly and I felt bad for the speakers that had to speak at the end!</p>
