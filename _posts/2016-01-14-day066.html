<p>These days I am a bit of a zombie, I managed to make some fixes to the payroll application, but not all what I wanted to do. Apart from that, and organizing lunch for this Friday, <strong>the highlight of the day was when we went for the five free meals we got from Chilango because they screwed up our order last Friday</strong>, and we even got one more for free. So I asked for something with shrimps and ALL the extras.</p>

<p>Because, hey, it was free. And BECAUSE I CAN.</p>

<p>I also fear that these blog posts are starting to look like <a href="http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1012">this</a>.</p>

<p>Oh, yeah! I also paired with Jarkyn in her clojure TicTacToe. </p>
<p>In other news, yesterday I saw my student from codebar after the holidays, and she told me that she traveled back to India and her grandma was almost murdered. And they can't do anything about it because the person who attacked her is a minor and won't receive a big punishment. Also, since her grandma talked to the police first, with no lawyer present, her story was changed. And even if all of that had gone well, you still can pay the police some money and they will let you free or testify whatever you want.</p>

<p>Apart from that, we are going to work on a project she wants to do before the 14th of February: a webpage for her boyfriend, with their memories, pictures, and all that. She also wants hearts and bunnies, and what not, and it was all SOO CHEESY THAT I HAD TO SAY YES, DO WHATEVER YOU WANT WITH ME.</p>

<p>WAT.</p>

<p>I DON'T JUDGE OK.<br>
	Whatever my students ask for, will be provided.</p>
