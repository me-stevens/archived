<p>After eight years working in the darkest corner of Mordor (I was young and crazy), <a href="https://www-win.gsi.de/frs/technical.asp">repeating</a> <a href="http://isolde.web.cern.ch/experiments-isolde">the</a> <a href="http://www.rcnp.osaka-u.ac.jp/eng/activities/lepton.html">same</a> <a href="https://www.jyu.fi/fysiikka/en/research/accelerator/nucspec">measurements</a> and simulating particle <a href="http://pro.ganil-spiral2.eu/laboratory/detectors/actartpc">detectors</a><sup><a href="#footnote">[1]</a></sup> that were never going to be build, I realized that I was being left behind in the technology station, while the world was moving forwards in the "actually do something with your life" train.</p>

<p>I stopped giving research yet another opportunity and moved on to very similar fields, like... <a href="http://octopusinvitro.tk">illustration</a>! and... comic art!</p> 

<p>But after a couple of years doing this, the nostalgia of those sleepless nights cracking weird ideas in front of a computer hit my little heart, so now I have a new (threatening) objective: to become an 8th Light knight and guide hordes of developers into wisdom and epicness.</p>

<p>This blog is going to be my diary where I'll share the many adventures I'll go through while becoming a decent person. I mean, a developer.</p>

<p id="footnote" class="footnote"><sup>[1]</sup> See how they say "funded in 2014"? I worked on that in 2005, when they had already been working on it for like five years.</p>
